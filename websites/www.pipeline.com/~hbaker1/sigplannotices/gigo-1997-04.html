<p>Twenty years ago, the US DoD asked "What color is my parachute
[programmed in]?"  The answer was `Green,' and the rest is history,
or so we have been told.  But there is more to this story--much, much
more.  By piecing together information from unclassified documents, we
are now able--for the first time--to bring you the real story of the
Ada Project, whose secrecy, scope and cost rival those of the
Manhattan Project.

<p>In the early 1970's, the US Department of Defense was facing a
software crisis of staggering proportions.  Software was becoming an
increasingly important component of defense systems, and the
percentage of software costs to hardware costs was rising
precipitously.  Something had to be done to bring these costs back
into balance.

<p>Our leaders understood well the issues:

<blockquote>...our warfighting strategy sustains and builds on...the
application of information technology to gain great military leverage
to continue to give us [an] unfair competitive advantage" [Perry96]</blockquote>

<p>Yet, the US was facing a `Software Gap' with the Soviets.
According to [Davis78], the Soviets had "one of the most potent
mathematical communities in the world":

<blockquote>To an unusual extent, software productivity is a research and
development activity, and thus it benefits from a relative Soviet
strength. ... <i>Thus
software would appear to have some relative advantages over hardware,
even within the scope of Soviet R&amp;D.</i>  ...One of the reasons mathematics has done
so well in the Soviet Union is that it is relatively insensitive to
the constraints [of high quality materials]...  <i>Software may have a similar advantage
as long as it can operate within local hardware limitations.</i>
[Davis78; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>

<p>Although Soviet computer hardware was inferior, particularly in memory
technology (typical Soviet computers had only a few hundred Kbytes
of core and a few tens of Mbytes of disk), Soviet software ingenuity
might make their hardware disadvantage moot:

<blockquote>The availability of ES hardware has resulted in
something of a ... software explosion...  [Davis78]</blockquote>

<p>Even more troubling were reports of incredible software productivity
from US projects using languages like Lisp, APL, Prolog, Smalltalk and
Forth.  Entire robotic planning systems with natural language and
graphics interfaces were programmed by just one or two people in Lisp.
Reams of PL/I code were replaced by a single line of APL.  Prolog
obsoleted a generation of Cobol programmers.  Smalltalk and Logo were
taught to children, and raised the spectre of a 12-year-old
outproducing a dozen beltway bandits.  Perhaps most troubling of all
was Forth, with its ability to very quickly program substantial
real-time systems that took insignificant amounts of memory.

<p>This software "productivity explosion" threatened the very axiom of
American military might--that more is better, and a whole lot more is
a whole lot better.  Software productivity was expanding faster than
software demand, and the trends predicted that by 1997 entire avionics
systems would be programmed by a single hacker in sandals, love beads
and a pony tail.  It looked like a handful of Soviet super-programmers
using these powerful new languages might wipe out any advantage from
American hardware prowess.

<p>The American military could not afford to ignore this Soviet software
threat.  Although the massive post-Sputnik spending to upgrade
American education had produced some early success, SAT scores soon
peaked and began a sickening decline.  Joe Geek might not be
able to compete mano-a-mano with Ivan Geek.

<p>US defense contractors were also hopping mad.  If the trend of the
increasing percentage of software to hardware continued, and the
productivity of software people exploded, total system spending would
fall precipitously.  In order to restore a proper balance, something
had to be done to dramatically increase the cost of computer hardware.

<p>After a number of top-secret meetings at the highest
levels, the "Ada Project" was conceived.  
{Rumors persist that the famous gap in the Nixon tapes
covered up such a discussion.  "We got some agreement that [low] cost
and [high] reliability was a problem, but the question was--what
could be done...  We got the problem passed to ... the Secretary of
Defense, which is raising it to the "highest level" in the DoD..."
[Whitaker93]}
The Ada Project was
to be a disinformation campaign of unprecedented scope and duration,
involving all of the branches of the military
(DARPA jeopardized the cover story by providing only lukewarm support), the
President, the Queen of England {[Whitaker93] discloses that
the Queen's email name is `<tt>EIIR</tt>', but gives no domain name; the
domain may be <tt>royal.gov.uk</tt> ("British Royalty Hold Court on the
Internet," <i>L.A. Times</i>, March 8, 1997)}, the Congress, and some
academics.  Its goal was to divert Soviet attention from truly
productive computer languages like Lisp, and convince them that only a
bloated, grossly inefficient, high order compiled language along the
lines of PL/I could be reasonably utilized in the deployment of
military embedded systems.  The use of a standardized, inefficient
language would provide a one-two punch: it would render
super-programmers useless, and it would increase the demands on
hardware by more than two orders of magnitude.

<p>The Ada Project was inspired by the unexpected success of the IBM
System/360 architecture behind the Iron Curtain.  The Ada Project's
wizards {the Ada Project was conceived at Kirtland AFB, NM,
near Roswell} reasoned that if the Soviets could be lured into
copying the 360 architecture, they could also be lured into copying
the Ada language, and if this language were fiendishly designed to
make real-time systems essentially impossible to program, then the
Soviet military machine would grind to a halt.

<p>Although Ada would also severely impact American software
productivity, it was felt that--just as cancer-fighting chemotherapy
nearly kills healthy tissue while it kills tumors--the healthier US
economy would be better able to bear the severe burden of an
unproductive software industry than the Soviet economy could.  Thus,
while American geeks were inferior to Soviet geeks, our Elbonian
hordes could beat their Mongolian hordes.

<p>However, convincing crack Soviet programmers--e.g., Ershov--to
believe in this disinformation campaign would be difficult:

<blockquote>There was also a strong bias on the part of Soviet programmers who
favored the `efficiency' of machine or assembly language programming.
<i>Clearly some of this bias rose from real considerations...</i>
[Davis78; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>

<p>The Ada Project's strategy for this problem was code-named `Dogfood.'
Just as dog food is purchased not by the dog himself, but by his
owner, Soviet programmers have little control over the computers that
they use.  Project Ada thus set up an elaborate top-down
bureaucracy in the finest central-planning tradition that would have a
special appeal for the Communist Party apparatchiks, and the Soviet
programmers would then be forced to go along.

<p>Even knowledge of the Ada Project's name required the highest
clearances and a need-to-know.  The code name itself was an inside
joke: Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, was a famous armchair
programmer/system architect who never in her entire life had gotten a
single program to compile, link, or run.  {An analogous joke
would be giving an Air Force plane the name "Kiwi," after a
flightless bird.}  Ada's code name was finally declassified--extensive
research had shown that no one ever got the inside
joke.  {`Project Ada' was not the first name suggested;
`Project Potemkin' was rejected when it was realized that Soviets
might recognize this old Russian ruse.}

<p>The Ada Project was designed from the beginning as a international
NATO project.  Without the complicity of other countries, it would
have had much less credibility with Ivan.  Furthermore, the American
military was not sure that American ingenuity could accomplish such a
fiendishly difficult task without help from abroad.  Prior to Ada, no
one had ever attempted to design a computer language whose primary
goal was dysfunctionality.  However, the timely appearance of
inscrutible documents from the European Algol-68 project provided hope
and guidance.

<p>The Ada Project's plan was absolutely brilliant.  Because high order
languages already in use by the various services and countries were
known to work moderately well, an excuse had to be found to not use
them.  The cover story was that interservice rivalries could be
minimized by not using these existing languages.  Neither could
existing "proprietary" languages like PL/I or Mesa be used; the
cover story was that single companies would unreasonably benefit.

<p>The C language was an exceptionally difficult case.  Although the C
language itself had lots of delicious ambiguities to exploit, it had
some major problems.  C was small and fast; it had small and fast
compilers; and it had been utilized by two people to build an entire
operating system that ran on small computers.  This was precisely the
sort of capability that would give Ivan an advantage, so C had to be
buried.

<blockquote>...[The Ada wizards] took advantage of this connection between DARPA and Bell
Labs to request their cooperation.  When Bell Labs were invited to
evaluate C against the DoD requirements, they said that there was no
chance of C meeting the requirements of readability, safety, etc., for
which we were striving, and that <i>it should not even be on the
list of evaluated languages.</i>  [Whitaker93; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, combinations of languages had to be examined in order to
make sure that no synergies precluded complete dysfunctionality.

<blockquote>All candidate languages were evaluated by more than one
contractor, and each contractor evaluated several languages, thereby
providing a technical crosscheck on the individual evaluations. ...for
each language requirement, the contractor was to determine the degree
of compliance of each of the candidate languages, to comment on the
feasibility of modifying the language to bring it into compliance, and
<i>to identify features in excess of the requirements.</i>
[Whitaker93; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>

<p>In order to be successful as a disinformation campaign, the Project
had to be `public' in such a way that innocuous internal documents
would be readily accessible to the Soviets to convince them of the
authenticity of the project.  The newly operational ARPANET fulfilled
this requirement with the help of nodes conveniently located in
neutral countries:

<blockquote>The project was extraordinarily well documented...  The requirements
were circulated externally, <i>certainly far more so than has any
other language effort, before or since</i>...  The language comparisons
and contract evaluations were published in excruciating detail and
<i>are available to the public</i>... ...there were numerous Language
Study Notes written and <i>made available to a large community over
the ARPANET</i>...  All issues submitted have been addressed, <i>and
results were available on the ARPANET</i>...  [Whitaker93; emphasis
supplied]</blockquote>

<p>Before putting the actual Ada language design out for bid, preliminary
requirements documents were developed--STRAWMAN, TINMAN, LIONKING,
etc.--all a bit dotty with just a little todo.
However, in finest waterfall tradition, the final requirements were
written <i>after</i> the winning language had already been defined.
These STEELMAN requirements [STEELMAN78] were a masterful example of
disinformation double-speak:

<blockquote><i>[The language] should emphasize program readability.</i>  [Translation: It should be nearly impossible to write a program that will compile or execute.]</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>There shall be no language restrictions that are not enforceable by
translators.</i>  [Translation: No reasonable
program will ever compile.]</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[The language] shall attempt to avoid features whose semantics
depend upon characteristics of the object machine</i>...  [Translation:
Issues critical to embedded systems like time and memory cost
must be avoided.]</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The language shall be completely and unambiguously defined.</i>
[Translation: By using English as the definition, we can put off
`completely and unambiguously' defining until enough experience has
been accumulated to make the decision that maximally reduces
productivity.]</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Every source program shall ... have a representation that uses only
the following 55 character subset of ... ASCII</i>...  [Translation: Ada
must stay within the character set limitations of Soviet I/O devices.]</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Separately translated units may be assembled into operational
systems.</i>  [Translation: Each system is to be shredded into small,
separately programmed units on a need-to-know basis, so that no one
person can comprehend it.]</blockquote>

<p>Four bidders developed languages: Red, Green, Blue and Yellow.
Although all four languages met the dysfunctionality requirements, the
Green language--an export of Bull--was chosen after evaluators were told that they were
voting on a new color for their uniforms.  Green's dysfunctionality
for embedded systems was outstanding:

<ul>
<li>no interrupts, prioritized or not
<li>a synchronization primitive that nobody had ever heard of and was
grossly expensive to implement
<li>no bit twiddling (no cyclic redundancy check or encryption codes)
<li>no ability to manage storage
<li>no guarantee of aborting a task
<li>no ability to manage scheduling
<li>no ability to interface to hardware
</ul>

<p>Ada initially planted a subconscious Y2K time-bomb: "YEAR: INTEGER
<b>range</b> 0..2000;" [Ada79, p.3-12], but then got Third Reich
ambitions: "YEAR: INTEGER <b>range</b> 0..4000;" [Ada83, p.3-34],
before settling on a Y2.1K time-bomb: "<b>subtype</b> YEAR_NUMBER
<b>is</b> INTEGER <b>range</b> 1901..2099;" [Ada83, p.9-11].  The
prospect of every piece of embedded military software in the
world simultaneously signalling a constraint error at the end of a
century was too delicious for the wizards of Ada to pass up,
and fixing these time-bombs would guarantee full employment for the
defense contractors they would retire to.

<p>The Ada Project had to publicly appear decisive in order to maintain
its credibility: "...all other implementations of new high order
programming languages for R&amp;D programs were halted."
[Whitaker93].  {In order to allow real systems to continue to
be developed, the Ada Project secretly granted a large number of
"waivers."}

<p>The time to produce working, validated compilers exceeded all hope.
Many years passed before the first validated compilers appeared, and
another two years before they could be run at a customer site without
crashing.  To establish credibility with the Soviets, the U.S. Navy
spent $40M developing a single Ada compiler.  This at a time when
they could have had four different compilers from four different
competing commercial Ada vendors for a total of $10M, or even
purchased all four independent Ada companies for less than $40M.

<p>The dysfunctionality of Ada exceeded all expectations.  A company
called Rational was formed to build a programming environment for Ada,
which itself was programmed in Ada.  The Rational machine could never
manage its own storage and had to be rebooted every few hours.
Another Ada company's compiler was written in Ada, with multiple tasks
for multiple compilations.  Neither could it manage its own storage,
and also had to be constantly rebooted.  If applications with minimal
real-time response requirements could not be programmed in Ada, what
hope would Ivan have with real-time avionics systems?

<p>The Ada compiler validation suite was cleverly designed to test only
exceptional cases, not common cases.  Its primary purpose was to detect
undocumented enhancements, in case such an enhancement might prove
useful and functional.  Validation thus proved only that the compiler
had no ambitions outside Ada; it said nothing about the ability
to recognize and compile legal Ada programs.

<p>The Ada validation suite also cleverly guaranteed that no
parser-generating tools could be used for the Ada language by
constraining the nature of syntax error messages, and by requiring
that all such errors be found in a single compilation.  The DIANA
intermediate data structure was also a stroke of genius, because any
compiler that used it used 10-100 times the memory of a C compiler
running on the same host.

<p>Because previous computer languages had evolved to become more
productive in response to user feedback, a mechanism had to be
developed to make sure that similar improvements could not happen to
Ada.  In order to keep Ada dysfunctional, very clever people
("Dystinguished Reviewers", or "Drs.") were appointed to dispatch
user questions according to a formal protocol:

<ul>
<li>Challenge the questioner's programmerhood.  Tell him that no
reasonable person would ever do this, and he should spend 3 more
months in a straightjacket at the Software Engineering Institute.
<li>Bury him in legalities.  Explain how the features of the language
had been carefully designed to fit together in a certain way, and he
couldn't begin to understand the wisdom of these decisions.
<li>Change the validation suite.  Make sure that these kinds of
programs won't even compile in the future.
<li>If worse comes to worst, "elucidate" the already "unambiguous"
definition in a way that guarantees that no one will ever want to
bring up a similar question again.  The new interpretation will
require all Ada systems to be revised in incompatible ways that also reduce
performance by another 3X.
</ul>

<p>In order that the Ada Project's cover not be blown, students were kept
away from actual Ada implementations.  It would have been most
embarrassing if a student were to compare Ada to Scheme, or even to
C--it might lead to an "Emperor's New Clothes" situation.  The
teaching of Ada was restricted to courses like `software engineering,'
where only `architecture' was argued and diagrams were drawn; programs
were never allowed to actually be compiled or run.

<p>`Software Reuse' was another goal of the Ada Project.  To further
reduce the cost of programming, programmers were encouraged not to
throw defective code away, but to recycle it.  At first, recycling
bins of different colors were set up.  Later, when things got GUI,
these bins were replaced by `trash icons' of different colors in the
corner of the screen.  Old versions and little bits of code that were
cut but never pasted were forwarded to the SIMTEL recycling center.
The SIMTEL recycling center's motto was: "we utilize everything but
the SQL."

<p>We now know that the Ada Project was very successful.  Ivan accepted
the Ada wizards' humbuggering at face value.  At the time of the Fall
of Communism, a number of Soviet Ada projects were under way, and
afterwards, at least one Soviet Ada compiler was offered for
commercial sale over the Internet.

<p>Now that the Wicked Witch of the East is dead, the wizards have
finally allowed Ada to evolve into Ada9X, which fixed some of Ada's
more egregious dysfunctions.  However, even today the brilliance of
Ada's original conception still shines brightly through.

<p>That the Ada Project was able to keep its secret for 20 years is a
tribute to the dedication and resourcefulness of the wizards of Ada.
It wasn't easy being Green--those associated with the Ada Project
withstood great criticism and still managed to keep a straight face.
The Ada Project cost billions and billions in direct and indirect
costs, but who can argue with the result?  All of us owe a great debt
of gratitude to those in the Ada Project who helped keep America free.
We agree with Churchill: "Never in the field of human conflict was so
much owed by so many to so few."  To memorialize those who fought
this valiant fight, we would like to dedicate The Cubicle of the
Unknown Programmer.

<p>Ada, we salute you!
