Figure 1(a).  <a href="number.html#item55">[Item 55]</a> This
diagram is to substantiate the claim that every Gaussian integer has a
unique bit combination.  Running through bit combinations 0, 1, 10,
11, ..., the diagram is a map of values, radix <i>i</i>-1.  The origin
is circled; the dot is at the 127th combination (1111111 = 2 +
5<i>i</i>), which is merely the last point drawn.<p>
