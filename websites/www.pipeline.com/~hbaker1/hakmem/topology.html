<h3>ITEM 113:</h3>

Although not new (cf Coxeter, <i>Introduction to Geometry,</i> 1st ed.
p393), the following coloring number (<i>chromatic number</i>) may be
useful to have around:

<pre>
N = [[(7 + sqrt(48 H + 1))/2]]
</pre>

where N is the number of colors required to color any map on an object
which has H holes (note: proof not valid for H = 0).<p>

For example:

<ul>

<li>A donut (holes = 1) requires 7 colors to color maps on it.</li>

<li>A 17-hole frob requires 17 colors.</li>

<li>An 18-hole frob requires 18 colors.</li>

</ul>

<h3>ITEM 114 (Schroeppel):</h3>

A most regular 7-coloring of the torus can be made by tiling the plane
with the following repeating pattern of hexagons of 7 colors:

<tt><pre>
 A A       C C       E E
A A A     C C C     E E E
 A A  F F  C C  A A  E E
     F F F     A A A
 B B  F F  D D  A A  F F
B B B     D D D     F F F
 B B  G G  D D  B B  F F
     G G G     B B B

     A A A     C C C

</pre></tt>

Draw an area 7 unit cell parallelogram by connecting, say, the center
B's in each of the four

<tt><pre>
 B B
B B B 's.
 B B
</pre></tt>

Finally, join the opposite sides of the parallelogram to form a torus
in the usual (Spacewar) fashion.  QUESTION (Gosper): is there a
toroidal heptahedron corresponding to this?

<h3>ITEM 115 (Gosper):</h3>

A spacefilling curve is a continuous map T -&gt; X(T),Y(T), usually
from the unit interval onto the unit square, often presented as the
limit of a sequence of curves made by iteratively quadrisecting the
unit square.  Each member of the sequence is then 4 copies of its
predecessor, connected in the shape of an inverted V, with the first
member being a V which connects 0,0 to 1,0.  The limiting map, X(T)
and Y(T), can be computed instead by a simple, finite-state machine
having 4 inputs (digits of T base 4), 4 outputs (one bit of X and one
bit of Y), and 4 states (2 bits) of memory (the number modulo 2 of 0's
and 3's seen in T).<p>

Let T, X, and Y be written in binary as:

<tt><pre>
T=.A B A B A B ...   X=.X X X X X X ...   Y=.Y Y Y Y Y Y ...
    1 1 2 2 3 3          1 2 3 4 5 6          1 2 3 4 5 6
</pre></tt>

ALGORITHM S:

0  1   0  1   0  1   0  1    This is the complete
0  1   1  0   0  0   0  1    state transition table.

To carry out either the forward or reverse map, label a set of columns as in
the table above.  Fill in whichever you know of AB or XY, with consecutive rows
corresponding to consecutive 1's.  Put 0 0 in the top position of the OLD CC
column.  Exactly one row of the above table will match the row you have written
so far.  Fill in the rest of the row.  Copy the NEW CC entry to the OLD CC
column in the next row.  Again, only one row of the state table will match, and
so forth.  For example, the map 5/6 -&gt; (1/2,1/2) (really .11010101... -&gt;
(.1000... ,.0111...)):

<tt><pre>
OLD                  NEW
C  C   A  B   X  Y   C  C
 0  1   I  I   I  I   0  1

0  0   1  1   1  0   0  1
0  1   0  1   0  1   0  1
0  1   0  1   0  1   0  1
0  1   0  1   0  1   0  1
.  .   .  .   .  .   .  .
.  .   .  .   .  .   .  .
    =  5/6  1/2  1/2
</pre></tt>

We note that since this is a one-to-one map on bit strings, it is not
a one-to-one map on real numbers.  For instance, there are 2 ways to
write 1/2, .1000... and .0111..., and thus 4 ways to write (1/2,1/2),
giving 3 distinct inverses, 1/6, 1/2, and 5/6.  Since the algorithm is
finite state, X and Y are rational iff T is, e.g., 898/4369 -&gt;
(1/5,1/3).  The

<a href="series.html#item122"><i>parity number,</i></a>

(see

<a href="series.html">SERIES</a>

section) and 1-(parity number) are the only reals satisfying X(T)=T,
Y(T)=1.  This is related to the fact that they have no 0's and 3's
base 4, and along with 0, 1/2, and 1=.111..., are the only numbers
preserved by the deletion of their even numbered bit positions.<p>
