<h3>ITEM 67 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Regarding "poker coins" game, whose rules are:

<ol>

<li>a player throws N coins; he then puts one or more aside and rethrows the rest</li>

<li>this throwing is repeated until he no longer has any to throw</li>

<li>highest score (dice) or maximum number of heads (coins) wins</li>

</ol>

For poker coins, the optimal strategy, with N coins thrown, is:<p>

Z = number of zeros (tails)

<ul>

<li>if Z = 0, quit</li>

<li>if Z = 1, throw the zero</li>

<li>if 1 &lt; Z &lt; N, save one one, throw the other N-1 coins</li>

<li>if Z = N, save a zero, throw the other N-1 coins</li>

</ul>

The optimal strategy for poker dice is hairier.

<h3>ITEM 68 (Schroeppel):</h3>

PROBLEM: Solve <i>Blackout</i>, a game as follows:<p>

Two players alternate placing X's on a rectangular grid.  No two X's
may appear adjacent along a side or across the diagonal at a corner.
The last X wins.<p>

Some theory: The "indicator" for a position is: make all possible moves from the
given position.<p>

Evaluate the indicator of each of these successor positions.<p>

The indicator of the first position is the smallest number which is not the
indicator of a successor position.  The indicator of the null position is 0.
The second player wins iff the indicator is 0.  Example of calculating an
indicator for the 3 x 3 board: There are 3 distinct moves possible -- corner,
side, center.  Playing in the center leaves the null position, indicator 0.
Playing on the side leaves a 1 x 3 line, indicator 2.  Playing in the corner
leaves a 3 x 3 L, indicator 3.  The smallest number not appearing in our list
is 1, so the indicator of a 3 x 3 square is 1.  For two boards (not touching)
played simultaneously, the indicator is the XOR of the indicators for the
separate boards.  For any position, the indicator is &lt;= the maximum game
length.<p>

PROBLEM: Find some non-exponential way to compute the indicator of a given
position.  For lines, a period of 34 is entered after the line is about 80
long.  For Ls: if one leg is held fixed, the indicator (as a function of the
other leg) seems to become periodic with period 34.  The time to enter the
period becomes greater as the fixed leg increases.<p>

<ul>

<li>On an odd x odd board, the 1st player wins.</li>

<li>On a 4 x N board, the 2nd player wins.</li>

<li>On a 6 x 6 board, the 1st player wins by playing at the center of one
quarter.</li>

</ul>

This indicator analysis is similar for many other take-away games, such as <i>Nim.</i>

<h3>ITEM 69:</h3>

Berlekamp of Bell Labs has done the 9 squares (16 dots) <i>Dots</i>
game; the 2nd player wins.

<h3>ITEM 70:</h3>

A neat chess problem, swiped from "Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood", by
Edward Lasker:<p>

white: pawns at QN3 and KN7, knight at QN4, bishop at KB8, king
at QB2;<p>

black: pawn at QN3, king at QR6.  White mates in three moves.

<a name="item71"></a>

<h3>ITEM 71 (Beeler):</h3>

There is only one distinct solution to the commercial "Instant Insanity"
colored-faces cubes puzzle, which is how it comes packed.  (Independently
discovered by Dave Plumer.)  Mike Paterson has discovered a clever way to solve
the puzzle.

<a name="item72"></a>

<h3>ITEM 72 (Beeler):</h3>

A <i>window-dice</i> game is as follows:

<ol>

<li>The player starts with each of nine windows open, showing the digits 1 - 9.</li>

<li>Roll two dice.</li>

<li>Cover up any digits whose sum is the sum on the dice.</li>

<li>Iterate throwing and closing windows until the equality of sums is
impossible.</li>

<li>Your score is the total of closed windows (highest wins).</li>

</ol>

An optimum strategy has been tabulated.  Usually it is best to take the largest
digits possible, but not always; it also depends critically on the remaining
numbers.

<h3>ITEM 73 (Beeler):</h3>

<i>Sim</i> is a game where two players alternately draw lines
connecting six dots.  The first person can always win, and whether his
first move connects with the first player's first move doesn't matter;
from there on, however, the strategy branches to a relatively gruesome
degree.<p>

PROBLEM: 6 dots is minimum to ensure no stalemate with 2 players; how many dots
are required with 3 players?

<a name="item74"></a>

<h3>ITEM 74 (Beeler):</h3>

The 4 x 4 game of Nim, also known as <i>Tactix</i>, is a win for the second player,
who on his first move can reply center-symmetrically unless the first player's
first move was B1 and B2 (analyzed on RLE PDP-1).

<h3>ITEM 75 (Gosper, Brown, Rayfield):</h3>

A 1963 PDP-1 computer program gave us some interesting data on the
traditional game of <i>peg solitaire</i> (33 holes in a plus shape).

<tt><pre>
    A B C
    D E F
G H I J K L M
N P Q . S T U
V W X Y Z 1 2

    6 7 8
</pre></tt>

From the starting position, complement the board.  This is the ending
position.  Now from the starting position, make one move, then
complement the board.  This is a position one move from a win.  By
induction, you can win from the complement of any position you can
reach.  Thus every successful game has a dual game whose positions are
the complements of the original ones.  This debunks the heuristic of
emptying the arms of the plus first and then cleaning up the middle,
because there are just as many dual games which empty out the middle
first and then the arms!  The program found one counterintuitive win
which at one point left the center nine empty but had ten in the arms.

    D E .
. . . . . . .
. P . . . T U
V W . . . . .
    . 4 .
    . 7 .
</pre></tt>

By dualizing and permuting a solution from the folklore, we found a
similar winning position with 20.  (T Q 4 R 1 L J H W Y M J) leaves:

<tt><pre>
    A B C
    D E F
G H . . . L .
N . . . . . U
V W . . . 1 2
    3 . 5
    6 7 8
</pre></tt>

then (8 V A C/B 2 6 G M F/K S 8 1 Y V 3 Q A H E).<p>

Another useful observation is that the pegs and their original hole
positions fall into four equivalence classes in which they stay
throughout the game.  Thus the four pegs which can reach the center on
the first move are the only ones that ever can.  Similarly, the peg
jumped over on the last move must be in one of the two classes of
eight members which get reduced on the first move.  The program's main
heuristic was to reduce the larger classes first.

<tt><pre>
    a b a
    c d c
a b a b a b a
c d c . c d c
a b a b a b a
    c d c
    a b a
</pre></tt>

With its heuristics disabled, the program simply scanned
lexicographically (left to right in the inner loop, then top to
bottom) for a peg which could move.  At one point, there is a peg
which can move two ways; it chose west.  Twelve moves from the end it
stopped and went into an exhaustive tree search, in which it found two
basically different wins.  (Try it yourself.)

<h3>ITEM 76 (Beeler):</h3>

Triangular <i>Hi-Q</i> (or peg solitaire) is 15 pegs in a triangle.
One peg is removed, and thereafter pegs jump others, which are
removed.  With pegs numbered 1 at the top, 2 and 3 in the next row,
etc.,

<tt><pre>
REMOVE  CAN END WITH ONLY THE PEG
1       1, 7 = 10, 13
2       2, 6, 11, 14
4       3 = 12, 4, 9, 15
5       13
</pre></tt>

Removing only one, no way exists to get to either 1 + 11 + 15 (tips)
or 4 + 6 + 13 (centers of sides).  Starting with peg 1 removed, 3,016
positions are attainable (not turning board); the sum of ways to get
to each of these is 10,306.  An example is: remove peg 1, then jump as
follows: 6, 13, 10, 1, 2, 11, 14/13, 6, 12/13, 15, 7/4, 13, 4; leaving
peg 1.<p>
