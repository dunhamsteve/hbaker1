<h3>ITEM 28 (Schroeppel):</h3>

After about 40 minutes of run time to verify the absence of any
non-trivial factors less than 235, the 125th Mersenne number,

<pre>
 125
2    - 1,
</pre>

was factored on Tuesday, January 5, 1971, in 371 seconds run time
as follows:

<pre>
 125
2    - 1 = 31 * 601 * 1801 * 269,089,806,001 * 4,710,883,168,879,506,001.
</pre>

John Brillhart at the University of Arizona had already done this.
M137 was factored on Friday, July 9, 1971 in about 50 hours of
computer time:

<pre>
 137
2    - 1 = 32,032,215,596,496,435,569 * 5,439,042,183,600,204,290,159.

<h3>ITEM 29 (Schroeppel):</h3>

For a random number X, the probability of its largest prime factor being

<ol>

<li>greater than sqrt(X)=X^(1/2) is ln 2.</li>

<li>less than X^(1/3) is about 4.86%.</li>

</ol>

This suggests that similar probabilities are independent of X; for
instance, the probability that the largest prime factor of X is less
than X^(1/20) may be a fraction independent of the size of X.<p>

RELEVANT DATA: ([] denote the expected value of adjacent entries.)

<tt><pre>
RANGE            COUNT          CUMULATIVE SUM OF COUNT
10^12 to 10^6    7198 [6944]    10018
10^6 to 10^4     2466           2820
10^4 to 10^3     354            402 [487]
10^3 to 252      40             48      ;252 = 10^2.4
252 to 100       7              8
100 to 52        1              1       ;52 = 10^1.7
51 to 1          0              0
</pre></tt>

where:<p>

"COUNT" is the number of numbers between 10^12 + 1 and 10^12 + 10018 whose
largest prime factor is in "RANGE".  The number of primes in 10^12 + 1 to 10^12
+ 10018 is 335; the prime number theorem predicts 363 in this range.  This is
relevant to Knuth's discussion of Legendre's factoring method, vol. 2, p.
351-354.

<h3>ITEM 30 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Twin primes:

<ul>

<li>166,666,666,667 = (10^12 + 2)/6</li>

<li>166,666,666,669</li>

</ul>

The number 166,666,666,666,667 is prime, but 166,666,666,666,669 is not.<p>

The primes which bracket 10^12 are 10^12 + 39 and 10^12 - 11.<p>

The primes which bracket 10^15 are 10^15 + 37 and 10^15 - 11.<p>

The number 23,333,333,333 is prime.<p>

Various primes, using T = 10^12, are:<p>

40 T + 1, 62.5 T + 1, 200 T - 3, 500 T - 1, 500 T - 7.

<a name="item31"></a>

<h3>ITEM 31 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Ramanujan's problem of solutions to

<pre>
 N        2
2  - 7 = X
</pre>

was searched to about N = 10^40; only his solutions (N = 3, 4, 5, 7,
15) were found.  It has recently been proven that these are the only
ones.  Another Ramanujan problem: Find all solutions of n! + 1 = x^2.

<a name="item32"></a>

<h3>ITEM 32 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Take a random real number and raise it to large powers; we expect the fraction
part to be uniformly distributed.  Some exceptions:

<ol>

<li><i>phi</i> = (1 + sqrt(5))/2</li>

<li>all - 1 &lt; X &lt; 1</li>

<li>sqrt(2) (half are integers, other half are probably uniformly
distributed)</li>

<li>1 + sqrt(2) -- Proof:

<pre>
             N                N
(1 + sqrt(2))  + (1 - sqrt(2))  = integer (by induction);

                 N
the (1 - sqrt(2))  goes to zero.
</pre></li>

<li>2 + sqrt(2) -- similar to 1 + sqrt(2)</li>

<li>any algebraic number whose conjugates are all inside the unit circle</li>

</ol>

Now, 3 + sqrt(2) is suspicious; it looks non-uniform, and seems to
have a cluster point at zero.  PROBLEM: Is it non-uniform?

<a name="item33"></a>

<h3>ITEM 33 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Numbers whose right digit can be repeatedly removed and they are still prime:
CONJECTURE: There are a finite number of them in any radix.  In decimal there
are 51, the longest being 1,979,339,333 and 1,979,339,339.

<a name="item34"></a>

<h3>ITEM 34 (Schroeppel):</h3>

PROBLEM: Can every positive integer be expressed in terms of 3 and the
operations factorial and integer square root?  E.g., 5 = sqrt(sqrt(3!!)).

<a name="item35"></a>

<h3>ITEM 35 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Take as many numbers as possible from 1 to N such that no 3 are in
arithmetic progression.  CONJECTURE: As N - &gt; infinity, the density
of such sets approaches zero, probably like

<pre>
 (ln 2)/(ln 3)
N             .
</pre>

<ul>

<li>XX.XX is a known solution for N = 5</li>

<li>XX.XX....XX.XX is a known solution for N = 14</li>

</ul>

Conjecture that XX.XX just keeps getting copied.  If the N^[(ln 2)/(ln
3)] can be proved, it follows that there are infinitely many primes
P1, P2, P3 in arithmetic progression, since primes are much more
common than N^[(ln 2)/(ln 3)].

<a name="item36"></a>

<h3>ITEM 36 (Schroeppel):</h3>

PROBLEM: How many squares have no zeros in their decimal expression?  Ternary?

<a name="item37"></a>

<h3>ITEM 37 (Gosper):</h3>

The number of n digit strings base B in which all B digits occur at
least once is just the Bth forward difference at 0 of the nth powers
of 0, 1, ... .  E.g., for n = 4:

<tt><pre>
  0     1     16    81   256   625
     1     15    65   175   369
        14    50   110   194
           36    60    84
              24    24
                  0
</pre></tt>

so there are 14 (= 2^4 - 2) such 4-bit strings, 36 such 4-digit
ternary strings, 24 (= 4!) such quaternary, and 0 for all higher bases.  27 (=
10e?) random decimal digits are required before it is more likely than not that
every digit has occurred; with 50 digits the likelihood is 95%.<p>

<a name="item38"></a>

<h3>ITEM 38 (Fredkin):</h3>

By the binomial theorem, the bth forward difference at 0 of the 0, 1, 2, ...
powers of n is (n-1)^b.  E.g., for n = 4:

<tt><pre>
  1     4    16    64   256
     3    12    48   192
        9    36   144
          27   108
             81
</pre></tt>

In fact, any straight line with rational slope through such an array
will always go through a geometric sequence with common ratio of the
form n^a (n-1)^b.  In the above, east by southeast knight's moves give
the powers of 12: 1, 12, 144, ... .

<a name="item39"></a>

<h3>ITEM 39 (Schutzenberger):</h3>

PROBLEM: Using N digits, construct a string of digits which at no time has any
segment appearing consecutively twice.

<ul>

<li>N = 2 -&gt; finite maximum string</li>

<li>N = 10 -&gt; known infinite</li>

</ul>

Determine maximum string length for N = 3.<p>

SUB-PROBLEM: How many sequence exist for any particular length?

<a name="item40"></a>

<h3>ITEM 40 (Gosper):</h3>

The variance of a pseudo-Gaussian distributed random variable made by adding T
independent, uniformly distributed random integer variables which range from 0
to N-1, inclusive, is T((N^2 - 1)/12).

<a name="item41"></a>

<h3>ITEM 41 (Salamin):</h3>

There are exactly 23000 primes less than 2^18.

<a name="item42"></a>

<h3>ITEM 42 (Gosper):</h3>

To show that

<pre>
   N
  ====
  \                                L  N + 1          N + 1  L
   >    BINOMIAL(N + L, L) ((1 - X)  X      + (1 - X)      X ) = 1
  /
  ====
  L = 0
</pre>

set N to 20 and observe that it is the probability that one or the
other player wins at pingpong.  (X = probability of first player
gaining one point, L = loser's score, deuce rule irrelevant.)  If this
seems silly, try more conventional methods.<p>

PROBLEM: If somehow you determine A should spot B 6 points for their
probabilities of winning to be equal, and B should spot C 9 points,
how much should A give C?

<a name="item43"></a>

<h3>ITEM 43 (Schroeppel):</h3>

Let (A, B, C, ...) be the multinomial coefficient

<pre>
(A + B + C....)!
----------------
  A! B! C! ...
</pre>

This is equal modulo the prime p to

<pre>
(A0, B0, C0...) (A1, B1, C1...) (A2, B2, C2...)...
</pre>

where AJ is the Jth from the right digit of A base p.<p>

Thus BINOMIAL(A+B, A) mod 2 is 0 iff (AND A B) is not.<p>

The exponent of the largest power of p which divides (A, B, C,...) is equal to
the sum of all the carries when the base p expressions for A, B, C, ... are
added up.

<a name="item44"></a>

<h3>ITEM 44 (Gosper):</h3>

Recurrences for multinomial coefficients:<p>

(A,B,C,...) = (A+B,C,...)(A,B) = (A+B+C,...)(A,B,C) = ...<p>

<a name="item45"></a>

<h3>PROBLEM 45 (Gosper):</h3>

<ul>

<li>Take a unit step at some heading (angle).</li>

<li>Double the angle, step again.</li>

<li>Redouble, step, etc.</li>

</ul>

For what initial heading angles is your locus bounded?<p>

PARTIAL ANSWER (Schroeppel, Gosper): When the initial angle is a
rational multiple of <i>pi,</i> it seems that your locus is bounded (in fact,
eventually periodic) iff the denominator contains as a factor the
square of an odd prime other than 1093 and 3511, which must occur at
least cubed.  (This is related to the fact that 1093 and 3511 are the
only known primes satisfying

<pre>
 P          2
2  = 2 mod P ).
</pre>

But a denominator of 171 = 9 * 19 never loops, probably because 9
divides <i>phi</i>(19).  Similarly for 9009 and 2525.  Can someone
construct an irrational multiple of <i>pi</i> with a bounded locus?
Do such angles form a set of measure zero in the reals, even though
the "measure" in the rationals is about .155?  About .155 = the
fraction of rationals with denominators containing odd primes squared
= 1 - product over odd primes of 1 - 1/P(P + 1).  This product =
.84533064 +- a smidgen, and is not, alas, sqrt(<i>pi</i>/2) ARCERF(1/4) =
.84534756.  This errs by 16 times the correction factor one expects
for 1093 and 3511, and is not even salvaged by the hypothesis that all
primes &gt; a million satisfy the congruence.  It might, however, be
salvaged by quantities like 171.

<h3>ITEM 46 (Schroeppel):</h3>

The most probable suit distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as
compared to 4-3-3-3, which is the most evenly distributed.  This is
because the world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic
effect saying things will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in
the state of lowest disordered energy.

<a name="item47"></a>

<h3>ITEM 47 (Beeler):</h3>

The Fibonacci series modulo P has been studied.  This series has a cycle length
L and within this cycle has sub-cycles which are bounded by zero members.<p>

The length of powers of primes seems to be

<pre>
                             power-1
L = (length of prime) * prime       .
</pre>

The length of products of powers of primes seems to be<p>

<pre>
L = least common multiple of lengths of powers of primes which are factors.
</pre>

There can be only 1, 2, or 4 sub-cycles in the cycle of a prime.<p>

Primes with 1 sub-cycle seem to have lengths

<pre>
     prime - 1
L =  --------- ,
         N
</pre>

N covering all integers.  Primes with 2 sub-cycles seem to have lengths

<pre>
                 M
     prime - (-1) 
L =  ------------- ,
          M
</pre>

M covering all integers except of form 10 K + 5.<p>

Primes with 4 sub-cycles seem to always be of form 4 K + 1, and seem
to have lengths

<pre>
      prime + 1    prime - 1
L =   --------- or --------- ,
          R            S
</pre>

R covering all integers of form 10 K + 1, 3, 7 or 9; S covering all integers.<p>

At Schroeppel's suggestion, the primes have been separated mod 40, which
usually determines their number of sub-cycles:

<tt><pre>
PRIME mod 40    SUB-CYCLES
1, 9    usually 2, occasionally 1 or 4 (about equally)
3, 7, 23, 27    2
11, 19, 31, 39  1
13, 17, 33, 37  4
21, 29          1 or 4 (about equally)
2 (only 2)      1
5 (only 5)      4
</pre></tt>

Attention was directed to primes which are 1 or 9 mod 40 but have 1 or
4 subcycles.

<pre>
    2       2
25 X  + 16 Y
</pre>

seems to express those which are 9 mod 40;

<pre>
           2        2
(10 X +- 1)  + 400 Y
</pre>

seems to express those which are 1 mod 40.<p>

PROBLEM: Can some of the "seems" above be proved?  Also, can a general
test be made which will predict exact length for any number?

<h3>ITEM 48 (Gosper, Schroeppel):</h3>

A point of the 2 dimensional lattice is called <i>visible</i> iff its
coordinates are relatively prime.  The invisible 2 by 2 square with
smallest X has its near corner on (14,20).  (I.e., (14,20), (15,20),
(14,21), and (15,21) are all invisible.)  The corresponding 3 by 3 is
at (104,6200).  By the chines remainder theorem, there exist invisible
sets of every finite shape.  Excellent reference: <i>Amer. Math.
Monthly,</i> May '71, p487.

<a name="item49"></a>

<h3>ITEM 49:</h3>

There is a unique "magic hexagon" of side 3:

<tt><pre>
     3  17  18
  19   7   1  11
16   2   5   6   9
  12   4   8  14
    10  13  15
</pre></tt>

First discovered by Clifford W. Adams, who worked on the problem from
1910.  In 1957, he found a solution.  (See Aug. 1963 <i>Sci. Am.,</i>
Math. Games.)  Other length sides are impossible.

<a name="item50"></a>

<h3>ITEM 50 (Schroeppel):</h3>

There is no magic cube of order 4.<p>

Proof: Let K (= 130) be the sum of a row.<p>

Lemma 1: In a magic square of order four, the sum of the corners is K.<p>

Proof: Add together each edge of the square and the two diagonals.  This covers
the square entirely, and each corner twice again.  This adds to 6 K, so twice
the corner sum is 2 K.<p>

Lemma 2:  In a magic cube of order 4, the sum of any two corners connected by
an edge of the cube is K/2.<p>

Proof:  Call the corners a and b.  Let c, d and e, f be the corners of any two
edges of the cube parallel to ab.  Then abcd, abef, and cdef are all the
corners of magic squares.  So a+b+c+d + a+b+e+f + c+d+e+f = 3K; a+b+c+d+e =
3K/2; a+b = K/2.<p>

Proof of magic cube impossibility: Consider a corner x.  There are three
corners connected by an edge to x.<p>

Each must have value K/2 - x.  QED

<a name="item51"></a>

<h3>ITEM 51 (Schroeppel):</h3>

By similar reasoning, the center of an order 5 magic cube must be 63 = K/5.<p>

COROLLARY: There is no magic tesseract of order 5.

<a name="item52"></a>

<h3>ITEM 52 (Salamin):</h3>

The probability that two random integers are relatively prime is 6/<i>pi</i>^2.<p>

PSEUDO-PROOF: Let X be the probability.  Let S be the set of points in the
integer lattice whose coordinates are relatively prime, so that S occupies a
fraction X of the lattice points.  Let S(D) be the set of points whose
coordinates have a GCD of D.  S(D) is S expanded by a factor of D from the
origin.  So S(D) occupies a fraction X/D^2 of the lattice, or the probability
that two random integers have a GCD of D is X/D^2.  If D unequals D', then S(D)
intersect S(D') is empty, and union of all S(D) is the entire lattice.
Therefore X*(1/1^2+1/2^2+1/3^2+...) = 1, so X = 6/<i>pi</i>^2.  This argument is not
rigorous, but can be made so.

<h3>ITEM 53 (Salamin):</h3>

The probability that N numbers will lack a Pth power common divisor is 1/<i>zeta</i>(NP).

<h3>ITEM 56 (Beeler):</h3>

The "length" of an N-digit
decimal number is defined as the number of times one must iteratively form the
product of its digits until one obtains a one-digit product (see <i>Technology
Review</i> Puzzle Corner, December 1969 and April 1970).  For various N, the
following shows the maximum "length", as well as how many distinct numbers
(permutation groups of N digits) there are:

<tt><pre>
 N     MAX L     DISTINCT
 2       4           54
 3       5          219
 4       6          714
 5       7        2,001
 6       7        5,004
 7       8       11,439
 8       9       24,309
 9       9       48,619

11      10      167.959
12      10      293,929
</pre></tt>

Also, for N = 10, 11 and 12, a tendency for there to be many fewer numbers of
"length" = 7 is noted.  Other than this, the frequency of numbers of any given
N, through N = 12, decreases with increasing "length", CONJECTURE (Schroeppel):
No L &gt; 10.

<h3>ITEM 57 (Beeler, Gosper):</h3>

There is at least one zero in the decimal expression of each power of 2 between

<pre>
 86                                           30739014
2   = 77,371,252,455,336,267,181,195,264 and 2        ,
</pre>

where the program was stopped.  If digits of such powers were random,
the probability that there is another zeroless power would be about
1/10^411816.  Assuming there aren't any raises the question:<p>

How many final nonzero digits can a power of two have?<p>

ANSWER (Schroeppel): Arbitrarily many.  If we look at the last n digits of
consecutive powers of 2, we see:

<ol>

<li>None end in zero.</li>

<li>After the nth, they are all multiples of 2^n.</li>

<li>They get into a loop of length 4 * 5^(n-1).  (Because 2 is a
primitive root of powers of 5.)</li>

</ol>

But there are only 4 * 5(n-1) multiples of 2^n which don't end with
zero and are &lt; 10^n, so we will see them all.  In particular, we
will see the one composed entirely of 1's and 2's, which ends

<h3>ITEM 60 (Beeler):</h3>

If S = the sum of all integers which exactly divide N, including 1 and N, then
"perfect numbers" are S = 2 N; the first three numbers which are S = 3 N are:

<pre>
           3
    120 = 2  * 3 * 5 = 1111000 base 2

           5
    672 = 2  * 3 * 7 = 1010100000 base 2

           9
523,776 = 2  * 3 * 11 * 31 = 1111111111000000000 base 2

<h3>ITEM 61 (Root):</h3>

Consider iteratively forming the sum of the factors (including 1 but not N) of
a number N.  This process may loop; "perfect numbers" are those whose loop is
one member, N.  For example, N = 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.  An example of a
two-member loop is:

<ul>

<li>sum of factors of 220 = 284</li>

<li>sum of factors of 284 = 220</li>

</ul>

Two-member loops are called "amicable pairs."<p>

A prime decade is where N+1, N+3, N+7 and N+9 are all prime.  The first
occurrence of two prime decades with the theoretical minimum separation is N =
1006300 and N = 1006330.  The 335th prime decade is N = 2342770.  There are
172400 primes &lt; 2342770.

<h3>ITEM 63 (Schroeppel, etc.):</h3>

The joys of 239 are as follows:

<ul>

<li><i>pi</i> = 16 arctan (1/5) - 4 arctan(1/239),</li>

<li>which is related to the fact that 2 * 13^4 - 1 = 239^2,</li>

<li>which is why 239/169 is an approximant (the 7th) of sqrt(2).</li>

<li>arctan(1/239) = arctan(1/70) - arctan(1/99) = arctan(1/408) + arctan(1/577)</li>

<li>239 needs 4 squares (the maximum) to express it.</li>

<li>239 needs 9 cubes (the maximum, shared only with 23) to express it.</li>

<li>239 needs 19 fourth powers (the maximum) to express it.</li>

<li>(Although 239 doesn't need the maximum number of fifth powers.)</li>

<li>1/239 = .00418410041841..., which is related to the fact that</li>

<li>1,111,111 = 239 * 4,649.</li>

<li>The 239th Mersenne number, 2^239 - 1, is known composite, but no factors are known.#</li>

<li>239 = 11101111 base 2.</li>

<li>239 = 22212 base 3.</li>

<li>239 = 3233 base 4.</li>

<li>There are 239 primes &lt; 1500.</li>

<li>K239 is Mozart's only work for 2 orchestras.</li>

<li>Guess what memo this is.</li>

<li>And 239 is prime, of course.</li>
