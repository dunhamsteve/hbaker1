<p>A simple real-time garbage collection algorithm is presented which
does not copy, thereby avoiding some of the problems caused by the
asynchronous motion of objects.  This in-place "treadmill" garbage
collection scheme has approximately the same complexity as other
non-moving garbage collectors, thus making it usable in a high-level
language implementation where some pointers cannot be traced.  The
treadmill is currently being used in a Lisp system built in Ada.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In 1978, we presented a relatively simple storage management
algorithm using garbage collection ("GC") which was "real-time"
("RT"), in the sense that all of its operations could be bounded by a
small constant, except for allocation, which was bounded by a small
constant times the size of the object being allocated

<a href="RealTimeGC.html">[Baker78].</a>

Since initialization requires time proportional to the size of the new
object, this algorithm was optimum, to within a constant factor.  The
key ideas of the paper were the tricolor marking scheme and the use of
the allocation pointer as a clock to measure the "time" until the
garbage collection must be finished.</p>

<p>Our 1978 paper had two major goals--to show that garbage collection
could be done in real time, and to show a relatively practical
algorithm.  After the discovery of the proof shown in that paper, and
before the discovery of the particular algorithm shown in that paper,
we considered a number of different strategies for implementing a
real-time garbage collector.  The search space included a number of
different dimensions, including copying v. non-copying, breadth-first
v. depth-first, mark-sweep v. non-mark-sweep.  The copying GC which
appeared in the paper was chosen because 1) it was space-efficient,
which appeared to be important for an embedded computer with all
"real" (non-virtual) memory; 2) it compacted by copying, which allowed
for the simplest allocation strategy--pointer incrementation; and 3) it
had a single phase, unlike the 2-phase mark-sweep algorithm.</p>

<p>We have since learned that compile-time garbage collection should
be used whenever possible

<a href="#chase88">[Chase88]</a>

<a href="#hederman88">[Hederman88]</a>

<a href="Share-Unify.html">[Baker90];</a>

that stack allocation should be used more often

<a href="LazyAlloc.html">[Baker91b];</a>

that functional objects should be treated differently from
non-functional objects

<a href="ObjectIdentity.html>[Baker93];</a>

that depth-first copying often causes fewer faults in a virtual memory
and/or caching environment

<a href="#moon84">[Moon84]</a>

<a href="#andre86">[Andre86]</a>

<a href="#wilson91">[Wilson91];</a>

that the asynchronous movement of objects is detrimental to compiler
optimization

<a href="#chase87">[Chase87]</a>

<a href="#chase88">[Chase88];</a>

and that more efficient allocation strategies exist

<a href="#brent89">[Brent89]</a>

<a HREF="#white90">[White90].</a>

A "conservative" garbage collector

<a href="#boehm88">[Boehm88]</a>

works much better without copying, since it can never be sure that all
pointers to an object have been found and updated.  Due to the greater
perceived costs of copying and due to the greater perceived benefits
of not copying, it now seems worthwhile to revisit an algorithm which
lost the initial real-time GC face-off.</p>

<h2>TRICOLOR MARKING</h2>

<p>We use 3 colors to mark the nodes of a rooted directed graph--white,
grey and black.

<a href="#foot1">[footnote 1]</a>

At the commencement of marking, all the nodes are white.  We then mark
the root nodes grey.  At any point during the marking, we find a grey
node, darken all of the nodes it points to, and then blacken it.
Marking terminates when there are no more grey nodes.</p>

<p>Real-time garbage collection overlaps marking and mutating (user
program execution).  The mutator is never allowed to see a white node.
If this policy is ever in danger of being violated,

<a href=#foot2">[footnote 2]</a>

the mutator marks the white node due to be accessed and continues.
Since a black node can never point directly to a white node without a
grey node intervening, and since the mutator only sees grey or black
nodes, this marking by the mutator is not harmful.  When marking is
done, we interchange the interpretation of the colors white and black
(at this point there are no grey cells), mark the roots grey, and then
restart the algorithm.</p>

<p>The copying algorithm in the 1978 paper mapped white nodes into
"fromspace" nodes, grey nodes into "tospace" nodes which had been
copied but not yet scanned, and black nodes into "tospace" nodes which
had been both copied and scanned.  This is not the only possible
mapping, however.</p>

<h2>IN-PLACE GARBAGE COLLECTION</h2>

<p>The only requirements of tricolor marking are: 1) it is easy to
enumerate free cells for allocation; 2) it is easy to enumerate grey
cells; 3) it is easy to determine the color of a cell; 4) it is easy
to change the color of a cell; and 5) it is easy to interchange the
interpretation of the colors white and black.</p>

<p><em>Doubly-linked lists</em>

<a href="#knuth73">[Knuth73,2.2.5]</a>

satisfy these requirements.  Consider a system of Lisp-like pairs
which have two extra "hidden" pointer components.  Initially, the
free-list is a doubly-linked list through these hidden pointer
components.  When a cell is allocated ("consed"), it is removed from
the free-list doubly-linked list, and inserted into the non-free-list
doubly-linked list.</p>

<p>In a non-real-time system, marking begins when the free-list
becomes empty.  All cells are on the non-free-list at this point;
i.e., all cells are white.  Marking begins by making the root cells
grey; i.e., transferring the root cells from the white list to a grey
list, which is done by unsnapping the cells from the one list and
snapping them into the other list.  Marking proceeds by unsnapping
cells from the grey list and snapping them into an initially empty
black list.  Since an empty grey list is easy to detect, the algorithm
will terminate with all accessible cells on the black (non-free) list
and all inaccessible cells on the white (free) list.  The mutator
continues after the interpretation of white and black has been
interchanged.</p>

<p>A real-time collection system is obtained by overlapping marking
and mutating, as in the 1978 paper.  If the mutator attempts to access
a white cell, it first darkens it by unsnapping it from the white list
and snapping it into the grey list for the marker to process; i.e.,
the algorithm utilizes a "read barrier".  The real-time system will
require <em>four</em> colors, however, since unmarked white cells must be
distinguished from cells on the free list;

<a href="#foot3">[footnote 3]</a>

i.e., unmarked white cells must use "off-white" (ecru) instead of the
"dead white" of the free-list.  At the end of marking, the ecru cells
are converted to dead white cells to form the new free list.

<a href="#foot4">[footnote 4]</a>

</p>

<p>It is easy to see that this "in-place" algorithm is real-time,
since the basic operations of determining a cell's color, changing a
cell's color (including unsnapping and snapping its links), etc., are
all constant-time operations.  If we incrementally update the simple
statistics required to calculate the appropriate "cons/mark" ratio

<a href="RealTimeGC.html">[Baker78],</a>

then this in-place system is real-time if and only if the original
copying system is real-time.</p>

<h2>THE TREADMILL OPTIMIZATION</h2>

<p>A new (1991) optimization for this algorithm is obtained by linking
<em>all</em> the cells into into the same large cyclic doubly-linked
list (the treadmill "tread"), while keeping the various colors in
contiguous subsequences of this list.  The four segments--white, grey,
black and ecru--are delimited by four pointers--<code>bottom, top,
free</code> and <code>scan.</code> We use the hidden links "forward"
and "backward" to orient this cyclic doubly-linked list.  We thus have
the pointers and segments in the following cyclic order:
<code>bottom,</code> ecru, <code>top,</code> grey, <code>scan,</code>
black, <code>free,</code> white, <code>bottom.</code> When the mutator
allocates a cell, the <code>free</code> pointer is moved one cell
"forward", thus changing a white (free) cell directly into a black
(allocated) cell.  When the cell under the <code>scan</code> pointer
has been scanned, the <code>scan</code> pointer is moved "backward",
thus changing a grey cell into a black cell.  To scan a grey cell, its
visible pointers must be checked.  If a scanned pointer is black or
grey, we do nothing, but if the scanned pointer is ecru, it is
unlinked from the ecru segment between <code>bottom</code> and
<code>top,</code> and relinked into the grey area, either at the
<code>scan</code> pointer--for depth-first ordering, or at the
<code>top</code> pointer--for breadth-first ordering.  Notice that
only one bit of color distinction must be stored in the cell--whether
or not it is ecru.</p>

<p>When the <code>scan</code> pointer meets the <code>top</code>
pointer, the collection cycle has finished, and when the
<code>free</code> pointer meets the <code>bottom</code> pointer, we
must "flip".  At this point, we have cells of only two colors--black
and ecru.  To flip, we make ecru into white and black into ecru;
<code>bottom</code> and <code>top</code> are then exchanged.  The root
pointers are now "scanned" by making them grey; the cells they point
to are unlinked from the ecru region and linked into the grey
region.(between <code>scan</code> and <code>top</code>).  We can
restart the collector, as it now has grey cells to scan.</p>

<p>The "treadmill" optimization eliminates the need to resnap links
during mutator allocation

<a href="#foot5">[footnote 5]</a>

and when changing from grey to black.  However, we must still resnap
links when changing from ecru to grey, since we need to separate the
accessible ecru cells from the garbage ecru cells.</p>

<p>In the exposition above, we explicitly "moved" cells from the ecru
list to the grey list.  On a multi-processor system, however, we might
rather move the cell directly from the white list to the black list,
but also put it onto a marker stack.  In this modified scheme, a grey
cell is a black cell which is also on the marker stack.  This
optimization may be useful in reducing the latency in the mutator's
read barrier.

<a href="#foot6">[footnote 6]</a>

</p>

<h2>COSTS</h2>

<p>We now compare the costs of the treadmill "in-place" algorithm to
the 1978 "copying" algorithm.  The in-place algorithm requires 2
additional pointers per CONS pair, but it does not require the
additional "tospace".  Therefore, for CONS pairs, the space
requirements are identical, and the in-place algorithm requires less
space for larger objects.

<a href="#foot7">[footnote 7]</a>

The cost of resnapping links is probably larger than that of copying
for CONS pairs, but for larger objects the in-place algorithm should
require less effort.

<a href="#foot8">[footnote 8]</a>

</p>

<p>If one uses a modern RISC architecture with a cache, and if both
hidden links of an object occupy the same cache line, then link
resnapping may not be nearly as expensive as a count of memory
references would indicate.  To enhance locality in a dual
(mutator-collector) processor system, one could separate the object
into two pieces--one piece holding the links visible to the mutator and
the other holding the links visible to the collector; this separation
would keep the cache consistency protocol from thrashing.</p>

<p>The biggest potential cost of an in-place algorithm, and the factor
which lost it a place in the 1978 paper, is the fact that the
free-list must be searched if objects of different sizes are managed

<a href="#baker89">[Baker89].</a>

In other words, allocation is no longer a simple pointer-increment
operation, but a search of a free-list for an amount of storage big
enough to satisfy the allocation.  Thus, the in-place algorithm
appears to be most useful when managing a homogeneous collection of
objects.</p>

<p>There are several possible solutions to this allocation problem.
Brent

<a href="#brent89">[Brent89]</a>

showed a first-fit technique for managing storage in which allocation
could be performed in O(log(w)) time, where w is the maximum number of
words allocated dynamically.  Jon L. White's technique

<a href="#white90">[White90]</a>

utilizes a hierarchy of bit-vectors which achieves O(log(s))
allocation time, where s is the amount of storage under
management.</p>

<p>Of course, these techniques only put off the inevitable
fragmentation caused by immobile objects of different sizes

<a href="#robson74">[Robson74].</a>

Bounds on the sizes of available memory blocks can be obtained by
combinatorial arguments; these bounds are not good, but are
worst-case, not average bounds.  We therefore have a situation with
poor worst-case bounds, but good average-case behavior; this may be a
trap for real-time systems designers, who should be preparing for the
worst, not the average, case

<a href="#baker89">[Baker89].</a>

</p>

<p>Brenda Baker

<a href="#baker85">[Baker85]</a>

has shown how a "buddy" storage system can be modified to "make space"
by moving objects when a large allocation request cannot be fulfilled
normally.  Her algorithm operates so long as memory is not already
full, and the time to allocate a block is proportional to the size of
the block.  All of these characteristics would make her scheme seem
ideal, except that the original goal of a motionless garbage collector
has not been achieved!</p>

<p>Thus, it would appear that if the allocation problem of large
immobile objects of different sizes could be solved, then our in-place
real-time variant would be an attractive way to collect garbage.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p>We have shown an elegant technique based on doubly-linked lists for
in-place real-time memory management which is isomorphic to our
original copying algorithm.  We are using this in-place real-time
garbage collector in a Lisp system built on top of the Ada programming
language

<a href="LPprogram.html">[Baker91a].</a>

Other authors

<a href="#yuasa90">[Yuasa90]</a>

<a href="#beaudoing91">[Beaudoing91]</a>

have shown in-place real-time algorithms based on the 2-phase
mark-sweep algorithm, although

has shown how to integrate the sweep phase with allocation.

<a href="#foot9">[footnote 9]</a>

<a href="#moss87">[Moss87]</a>

uses a similar doubly-linked list to manage the stack frames of
Smalltalk.  Doubly-linked lists can also be used to convert
generational copying garbage collectors

Given the date of this real-time GC algorithm (1976), we now wish that
we had used the colors white, red and blue.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot2">[Footnote 2]</a>

A "read barrier" checks for this violation.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot3">[Footnote 3]</a>

<a href="#kung77">[Kung77]</a>

also uses the same color scheme for his <em>parallel</em> garbage
collector, which uses the two phases mark and sweep; that collector
does not meet our definition of real-time, however.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot4">[Footnote 4]</a>

This color change to dead white can be accomplished by brute force, as
in "Ecru, Brute!"</p>

<p>

<a name="foot5">[Footnote 5]</a>

A real-time system may sometimes find it advantageous to increase the
number of cells under management by allocating a cell external to the
"tread" and snapping it in during a CONS.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot6">[Footnote 6]</a>

<a href="#kung77">[Kung77]</a>

uses a queue with two ends ("dequeue") for the same purpose; the
second end reduces conflicts between the mutator and the collector.
If cells greyed by the mutator were resnapped at the top pointer,
while cells greyed by the collector were resnapped at the scan
pointer, then we would have a close approximation to Kung's
dequeue.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot7">[Footnote 7]</a>

We ignore here fragmentation, which has been called "storage erosion"
in real-time systems.  Storage erosion is analogous to land
erosion--the land is still there, but has become so eroded as to be
useless for cultivation.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot8">[Footnote 8]</a>

On a virtual memory system, however, one does not have to physically
copy large objects even when one is using a "copying" garbage
collector algorithm.  This is possible if large objects are always
located on their own set of pages, so that the algorithm need only
diddle the page map instead of physically copying these objects.  This
optimization is especially valuable for large structures of raw bits,
such as color bitmaps.  Therefore, one cost associated with a
relocating collector is saved; other costs remain, however, such as
the costs of updating all pointers and foregoing some compiler
optimizations.</p>

<p>

<a name="foot9">[Footnote 9]</a>

It is rumored that this idea goes back at least to Fitch and/or
Norman at the U. of Bath???</p>
