<b>Shallow binding is a scheme which allows the value of a variable to be
accessed in a bounded amount of computation.  An elegant model for shallow
binding in Lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment
tree transformation called <i>rerooting</i>.  Rerooting is completely general
and reversible, and is optional in the sense that a Lisp 1.5 interpreter will
operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked on every context change.
Since rerooting leaves <i>assoc[v,a] </i>invariant, for all variables <i>v</i>
and all environments <i>a</i>, the programmer can have access to a rerooting
primitive, <i>shallow[]</i>, which gives him dynamic control over whether
accesses are shallow or deep, and which affects only the speed of execution of
a program, not its semantics.  In addition, multiple processes can be active in
the same environment structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible
operation.  Finally, the concept of rerooting is shown to combine the concept
of shallow binding in Lisp with Dijkstra's <i>display</i> for Algol and hence
is a general model for shallow binding.</b><p>

<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>

A severe problem in Lisp 1.5

<a href="#ref6">[6]</a>

systems is the amount of time required to
access the value of a variable.  This problem is compounded by Lisp's choice of
"fluid" or "dynamic" scoping for nonlocal (free) variables, wherein a
procedure's free variables are considered bound in the environment of the
caller (or the caller's caller, etc.).  On the other hand, Algol and most other
computer languages (with the major exception of APL) use a <i>lexical</i>
scoping rule in which the free variables of a procedure are bound in the block
which lexically (textually) embraces the procedure.  Dynamic scoping leads to
environment trees at run-time which are "tall and thin" rather than "short and
bushy" because the topology of the environment tree follows that of the
run-time stack rather than the block structure of the source text.  Since the
length of time to access the binding of a variable in the original Lisp 1.5
implementation

<a href="#ref6">[6]</a>

is proportional to the distance in the tree from the current
environment to the place where that variable is bound, this time can
be quite large for the tall environment trees actually encountered.
For example, accessing a global variable from the bottom of a deep
recursion requires time proportional to the depth of the recursion.<p>

The Maclisp interpreter

<a href="#ref7">[7]</a>

solves this problem through a scheme called
"shallow binding".  In this scheme, each variable has a <i>value cell</i>,
which can be accessed in constant time, and the bindings associated with the
current environment are kept in these value cells so that they can be accessed
without any search.  Whenever a context change occurs, such as when calling or
returning from a function, some of the value cells must be changed or restored.
Since Lisp uses dynamic variable scoping, the changes in the environment mirror
those in the return-point stack, so Maclisp saves the old bindings from the
value cells on a parallel stack called the <i>specpdl</i><a
href="#fn0">\1/</a> when calling a procedure and restores
them from the specpdl when returning from a procedure.  As a result, variable
access time in Maclisp is constant and context-switching time is unbounded,
whereas in so-called deep binding systems like Lisp 1.5, the access time is
unbounded and the context-switching time is constant.  Thus, a tradeoff exists
between the time needed to access the binding of a variable and the time needed
to switch contexts, and whenever variable access is more common than context
switching, shallow binding is more efficient.<p>

However, the scheme used in Maclisp cannot be used to implement shallow binding
in Lisp 1.5, because it does not handle function-producing functions (so-called
<i>upward</i> FUNARG's

<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>

) correctly.  In fact, no stack-based environment
structure can do so because using LIFO allocation discipline for Lisp
environment nodes can lead to the premature unbinding of the free variables
required by these upward FUNARG's.  On the other hand, our model for shallow
binding keeps a <i>tree</i> environment structure and allocates environment
nodes in the heap, and it is therefore capable of handing full FUNARG's.

<h2>2.  The Environment Tree Rerooting Model</h2>

In our model, the environment structure consists of an <i>environment tree</i>,
a current environment ("you are here") <i>pointer</i>, and a global <i>value
cell</i> for each variable name.  An environment tree node consists of a pair
of pointers <i>&lt;binding,parent&gt;</i>, where <i>binding</i> is a pair
<i>&lt;name,value&gt;</i>, and <i>parent</i> is another environment node or the
distinguished pointer NIL.  The interpretation of an environment node <i>E'</i>
= <i>&lt;&lt;name,value&gt;,E&gt;</i> is that the value of a variable in
<i>E'</i> is the same as the value of that variable in <i>E</i>, unless it is
the variable <i>name</i>, in which case it has the value <i>value</i> in the
environment <i>E'</i>.  The value cell of each variable, on the other hand,
contains the <i>default</i> binding of that variable, i.e. the binding to be
used if the variable is not bound in any environment node along the "parent"
path from the current environment node to the root in the environment tree.<p>

The system is initialized so that the current environment pointer points to the
top level environment, an environment node having a dummy binding and a NIL
parent, thus identifying it as the current root.  The value cell of each
variable is initialized to its top level binding, i.e. the pair
<i>&lt;variable-name,top-level-value&gt;</i>, where the redundant
<i>variable-name</i> simplifies programs presented later.  If the variable has
no top level value, <i>top-level-value</i> is the distinguished indicator
"UNBOUND", which causes a trap if the interpreter tries to return it as the
value of a subexpression.<p>

The algorithm for accessing a variable is: 1) search the environment tree from
the current environment to the root, and if the variable name is found, use the
associated binding; else 2) use the binding in the value cell.  Figure 1 gives
Mlisp-like code for a version of Lisp's assoc function which implements this
algorithm.

<tt><pre>
Fig.  1.  Variable lookup mechanism.

assoc[v,a] = 	// Return the binding of v in the environment a.
  [parent[a]=NIL      -&gt; vcell[v];
   v=name[binding[a]] -&gt; binding[a];
   T                  -&gt; assoc[v,parent[a]]]

parent = CDR 	// Parent, binding, and name are new names
binding = CAR 	// for cdr, car, and car, respectively.
name = CAR

vcell[y] returns the value cell of variable y, which is a cons cell having
the structure (y . value[y]), in constant time.
</pre></tt>

So far we have described a conventional deep binding interpreter in which the
<i>global</i> or <i>top level</i> value of each variable is kept in its value
cell.  In order to convert this system into a <i>shallow</i> binding system, we
need only make sure that the distance from the current environment to the root
in the environment tree is <i>short</i>; i.e. <i>we make sure that the current
environment is always the root</i>.  In this case, the search is always trivial
and is eliminated.<p>

The way that we do this is to <i>reroot</i> the environment tree at each
context-switch,<a href="#fn1">\2/</a> so that the context
to be switched to becomes the new root.  The rerooting algorithm is quite
simple.  Suppose that <i>E</i> is the current root of the environment tree and
<i>E'</i> is any other node in the tree which we wish to become the new root.
Since <i>E</i> is the current root of the tree, the "parent" path in the tree
from <i>E'</i> will terminate at <i>E</i>.  We make two passes over that path,
one forward pass and one backward pass.  On the forward pass, we go from
<i>E'</i> to <i>E</i>, stacking the nodes as we go.  On the backward (relative
to the original path) pass, we go from <i>E</i> back to <i>E'</i>, reversing
the binding links and exchanging the values in the association pairs with those
in the value cells.  This has the effect of terminating with the proper values
for <i>E'</i> in the value cells.<p>

Figure 2 presents a modified <i>assoc</i> function which gets a variable
binding directly from its value cell without any search and a modified
<i>apply</i> function which reroots the environment tree whenever a context
switch is made.  These functions are intended to work with a Lisp interpreter
like that found in the Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual

<a href="#ref6">[6].</a>

<tt><pre>

assoc[v,a] = vcell[v] 	// Return the binding of v in the current environment a.

apply[f,x,a] = 	// Apply function f to arguments x in environment a.
  [atom[f]       -&gt;[f=CAR  -&gt; caar[x];
                    f=CDR  -&gt; cdar[x];

   car[f]=FUNARG -&gt; prog1[apply[cadr[f],x,caddr[f]],reroot[a]]]

pairlis[vars,vals,a] = 	// Extend environment a with new bindings of vars to vals.
  [vars=NIL -&gt; a;
   T        -&gt; cons[cons[car[vars],car[vals]],pairlis[cdr[vars],cdr[vals],a]]]

reroot[a] = 	// Make a the new root.
  [parent[a]=NIL -&gt; a; 	// a is already the root.
   T             -&gt; onestep[a,reroot[parent[a]]]]

onestep[new,old] = 	// new is new root; old is old root.
  prog[[];
       parent[new] := NIL, 	// Reverse binding link.
       parent[old] := new,
       binding[new] :=: binding[old],
       binding[old] :=: vcell[name[binding[old]]]; 	// Exchange binding with value cell.
       return[new]]

progi[&lt;e1&gt;, &lt;e2&gt;, ..., &lt;en&gt;] evaluates &lt;e1&gt;, &lt;e2&gt;, ..., &lt;en&gt; in order and
returns the value of &lt;ei&gt;.
":=:" indicates an exchange operation.
</pre></tt>

We outline a proof of correctness for our model in two stages.  We show that
the root of the environment tree can be moved one step while preserving
<i>assoc[v,a] </i>for all variables <i>v</i> and all environments <i>a</i>, and
then we exhibit a rerooting procedure which finds an appropriate directed path
for the root movement and moves it by iterating the single-step method.<p>

To prove that single-step movement is possible, consider the two nodes <i>E</i>
and <i>E'</i> of the environment tree in Figure 3.  Before the transformation,
<i>E</i> is the root and <i>E'</i> is some other node exactly one step from the
root.  Now since <i>E'</i> is only one step from <i>E</i>, it differs from
<i>E</i> in the value of exactly one variable, which we can assume to be <i>"X"
</i>without loss of generality.  Now since <i>E</i> is the root, <i>X'</i>s
binding to <i>x</i> in that context is stored in <i>X'</i>s value cell.  The
directed link from <i>E'</i> to <i>E</i> encodes the fact that the binding of
<i>X</i> in <i>E'</i> is different, namely <i>x'</i>.<p>


Fig. 3.  The one step environment transformation.
<p>

<IMG SRC="ShallowBinding1.gif">
<p>

Now to reroot the tree at <i>E'</i>, we need only rearrange values and pointers
in such a way that the bindings returned by <i>assoc</i> for both <i>E</i> and
<i>E'</i> are not affected, yet <i>E'</i> becomes the new root.  The
appropriate change is to invert the link between <i>E'</i> and <i>E</i>, and
exchange the binding on the link (&lt;<i>X</i>,<i>x'</i>&gt;) with the binding
in <i>X'</i>s value cell (&lt;<i>X</i>,<i>x</i>&gt;).  This accomplished, we
notice that <i>assoc</i> will still return the correct binding for <i>X</i> in
both <i>E'</i> and <i>E</i>.  Furthermore, the bindings of other variables in
<i>E</i> and <i>E'</i> have not been affected, since those bindings remain in
their value cells.  Finally, the bindings of variables in contexts which point
to <i>E'</i> or <i>E</i> have not changed, since <i>E'</i> and <i>E</i> retain
their identities in the values they assign to variables.  Thus, single step
root movement is possible, and can be iterated to make any node in the tree the
root.<p>

However, if we desire to make a root from an arbitrary node, we must
interpolate a path from the root to that node since the root may move only one
step at a time.  Since the environment structure is a tree, such a path always
exists and is unique.  The rerooting procedure described above traces this path
forwards from the arbitrary node to the root and iterates the single-step
transformation on the way back.<p>

Since the parent links must be reversed on the second pass anyway, we can
reverse them on the first pass and avoid the use of a stack.  Figure 4
illustrates this technique.  This program for rerooting has much in common with
the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite stackless list-tracing technique

<a href="#ref5">[5].</a>

<tt><pre>

reroot[a] = 	// Make a the new root using Deutsch-Schorr-Waite.
 prog[[r,b,p]
      r := nreverse[a], 	// Reverse a as in D-S-W.
      b := binding[r], 	// Save dummy binding from the old root.
      p := r, 	// Initialize p for loop.
   while parent[p] != NIL
   do prog3[binding[p] := binding[parent[p]],
            binding[p] :=: vcell[name[binding[p]]],
            p := parent[p]],
   binding[a] := b,
   return[a]]

nreverse[a] = nreconc[a,NIL] 	// Destructively reverse list a, by flipping CDR pointers.

nreconc[a,b] = 
  [a=NIL -&gt; b;
   T     -&gt; nreconc[cdr[a],rplacd[a,b]]]

rplacd[x,y] = prog2[cdr[x]:=y,x]
</pre></tt>

The continuous shallow binding interpreter presented above is equivalent to the
Maclisp interpreter for that class of Lisp programs which do not have FUNARG's,
in the sense that the tree environment it creates consists of a single
<i>path</i> (tree with no branches) which is isomorphic to the Maclisp
<i>specpdl</i>.  However, our implementation of the model, being simple for
pedagogic reasons, is not necessarily the most efficient way to perform shallow
binding; e.g. since our environment nodes live in the heap rather than on a
stack, they are more costly to reclaim.

<h2>3.  Storage Requirements of Shallow Binding vis &aacute; vis Deep Binding</h2>

Our shallow-binding model requires a value cell for every variable used by a
program in addition to the storage required by the accessible environment tree
nodes.  Therefore, the storage requirements are at least superficially the same
as for a deep-binding model with global value cells.  However, one could
conceive that, due to the pointer rearrangement in our model, the two models
might differ in the details of when particular environment nodes (and hence the
values to which they point) can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.  It so
happens that this is <i>not</i> the case; the models are equivalent in the
sense that the time-varying set of accessible nodes is precisely the same in
both models.  The proof is beyond the scope of this paper, but depends on the
fact that rerooting preserves the in-degree of all environment nodes, except
for the old and the new roots.  This accessibility equivalence to deep binding
is a nontrivial property of our shallow-binding model; some other models, such
as deep binding with a <i>cache cell</i> for each variable

<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>

<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>

<a href="#ref10">[10],</a>

may retain
pointers to nodes long after they would have become inaccessible in the
deep-binding model.

<h2>4.  Casual Rerooting</h2>

Suppose now that we have a standard deep binding (nonrerooting) Lisp 1.5
interpreter which has been augmented by the <i>shallow[]</i> primitive (see
Figure 5).  When this primitive is invoked, the environment tree will be
rerooted to the current environment.  Rerooting transforms the environment tree
in such a way that <i>assoc[v,a]</i> is left invariant; therefore the
interpretation proceeds correctly, but the length of variable searches is
reduced.  In other words, the interpreter may <i>casually</i> reroot instead of
rerooting at every context switch without affecting the semantics of the
language.

<tt><pre>
Fig.  5.  Casual shallow-binding interpreter.

assoc[v,a] =  	// The original deep-binding assoc.
  [parent[a]=NIL      -&gt; vcell[v]; 	// Is a the root?
   v=name[binding[a]] -&gt; binding[a];
   T                  -&gt; assoc[v,parent[a]]]

apply[f,x,a] =
 [atom[f]       -&gt; [f=CAR -&gt; caar[x];
                    ...
                    f=SHALLOW -&gt; prog2[reroot[a],T] 	// Return T as value of shallow[]
                    T -&gt; apply[eval[f,a],x,a]];
  car[f]=LAMBDA -&gt; eval[caddr[f],pairlis[cadr[f],x,a]];
  car[f]=FUNARG -&gt; apply[cadr[f],x,caddr[f]]]
</pre></tt>

This flexibility to run some functions shallow and some deep may reduce overall
running time.  For example, a tight loop might run faster when shallow bound,
while an interrupt handler might run better deep bound, since rerooting can be
time consuming.<p>

Lisp 1.5 can also be augmented with primitives for multiprocessing such as
<i>fork</i>, <i>P</i>, and <i>V</i>.  Several processes can be active in the
same environment tree in such a system.  Since rerooting preserves the value of
<i>assoc[v,a]</i>, executing <i>shallow[]</i> in any process cannot affect the
values of the variables in the other processes so long as rerooting is
indivisible.<a href="#fn2">\3/</a> Of course, if more
than one process tries to do continuous shallow binding, then we will get a
form of <i>thrashing</i> in which the system spends all of its time rerooting!

<h2>5.  Dijkstra's Display as a Shallow Binding Technique</h2>

Dijkstra's <i>display</i> technique for fast variable access in lexically
scoped languages

<a href="#ref9">[9]</a>

can be brought under the purview of our model, but we must
first reformulate it.  Each variable reference in an Algol 60 program is
normally compiled as a reference to an offset within the current activation
record for the block which defines its scope.  One could conceptually<a
href="#fn3">\4/</a> rewrite (i.e. do a source-to-source
translation on) the Algol program in such a way that every block has exactly
one variable a pointer variable which points to the current activation record
for that block and all references to the original variables are mapped into
offset references to these activation records via the pointer variables.<a
href="#fn4">\5/</a>  Call these introduced pointer
variables <i>display variables</i> and notice that they are the only variables
left in the program.  Finally, give them names which correspond to their
lexical depth in the program such as "<tt>Display_variable_depth_1</tt>" or
"<tt>Display_variable_depth_6</tt>"; this naming assignment is consistent with
the lexical scoping rule.<a href="#fn5">\6/</a><p>

We now see that these display variables are the ones being shallowly bound in
Dijkstra's display vector; indeed, the display is simply a vector of memory
locations each acting as a value cell for a display variable.<p>

Rerooting is thus a value-preserving transformation on a tree environment
structure and has nothing to do with how the structure was created; e.g. the
interpreter could use either lexical or dynamic scoping, or even some
combination of the two

<a href="#ref1">[1].</a>

<h2>6.  Roots</h2>

Our algorithm was discovered by pondering the Greenblatt Lisp machine proposal

<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>

which also describes a shallow scheme for handling general FUNARG's.  His
scheme does not reverse any pointers, but appends an "up/down" bit to each node
in the environment tree which essentially indicates whether that link would
have been reversed in our scheme.  His less general method <i>must</i>
continuously shallow bind because the pointers in the "down" path (the set of
links which our model would have reversed) point in the wrong direction to be
used by <i>assoc</i>.  Our scheme both simplifies and generalizes his so that
not only can shallow binding be implemented more uniformly, but we also get the
serendipitous benefit of being able at any point to choose between shallow and
deep binding.<p>
