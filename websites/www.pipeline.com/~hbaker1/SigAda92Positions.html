<h2>Defense AI Applications in Ada-83?  In Ada-9X?  What are the issues?</h2>

Can AI programs be successfully written and deployed in Ada-83?  Do the changes
contemplated in Ada-9X make the writing and deployment of AI programs any
easier?  Do there still exist major "gotchas" in Ada-9X which will seriously
decrease the performance and/or increase the cost of developing and deploying
AI programs in Ada?<p>

AI programs are some of the largest <i>programs</i> around, in terms of lines
of code, complexity, cost, etc.  I.e., they are large <i>programs</i>, but
small amounts of <i>data</i>, relative to more traditional embedded systems
programs.  E.g., <i>compiled</i> program text of large AI system can take 20
megabytes, whereas "large" non-AI programs use 1-2 megabytes for both program
and data (not counting large passive databases such as terrain mapping
databases).<p>

What are the design, implementation and maintenance implications of such large
programs in an Ada environment?  E.g., small changes may cause massive
recompilations--it could take hours or days to "make" a new version of a
system.  With a program of this size, is it <i>ever</i> "delivered"?  If only
10^-3 of such a program is changed annually, this may still be 10,000 lines of
code changed per year.  Rumors exist of massive software changes/fixes for the
Patriot missile system while the unit was already in battle.  Significant
changes may be required in a "Pilot's Associate" program <i>for every
mission</i>.  In other words, "program" may have become "data", to be loaded
for each and every mission.  Does this mean that "dynamic loading" a la
Berkeley Unix or Unix V Rel. 4 should become part of an Ada run-time system?
Does this require a "persistent Ada heap", a la current "object-oriented
databases"?<p>

A "signature" characteristic of AI programs is their "late binding" of control
constructs, which are universally implemented by means of first-class function
closures.  These closures are dynamically constructed functions which can be
passed as arguments, returned as values, and stored into data structures as
values.  Ada-83 was expressly forbidden by its Steelman Requirements to have no
such capability.  Ada-83 offers <i>generic</i> functions and procedures, which
can emulate some, but not all, of these late binding constructs.  Do the
capabilities of Ada-9X provide enough relief to satisfy the AI developer, or
should we send the Ada-9X team back to the drawing board?<p>

AI people have been requesting garbage collection for Ada at least since 1980
[Schwartz80], yet no vendor provides it, and Ada compiler/runtime validation
does not require garbage collection.  Yet GC is an extremely valuable tool in
allowing the decomposition of large systems without increasing the probability
of failure due to <i>dangling references</i>.  Such dangling references are
becoming more and more likely with the dramatic increase in pointer-based
programs due to the popularity of "object-oriented" programming.  Can garbage
collection be emulated on top of Ada with enough efficiency to support the
heavy computational demands of AI programs?<p>

Traditional AI systems require a large address space and the shared-memory
paradigm.  Yet many embedded systems are designed with hardware that supports a
distributed-memory/message-passing model, and it may be quite difficult to map
AI programs onto these platforms.  The Ada parallel process model clearly
prefers an explicit exchange of information via the rendezvous mechanism, and
only grudgingly supports the notion of asynchronous access to shared data.  Yet
the most popular model for parallel, embedded real-time AI systems is the
"blackboard" model, which has at its core a database shared and asynchronously
updated by all processes!<p>

Although Ada was standardized in 1983, production quality compilers were not
available until the 1986-87 time frame, and significant bugs are still
prevalent in Ada83 compilers today.  For example, generics could not be used
reliably in the first generation of Ada83 compilers, and "storage leaks"
continue even in today's Ada83 runtime systems.  Thus, it seems prudent to
recognize that it may be 1995 before debugged, reliable compilers and runtime
systems are available for Ada-9X.  In this case, another generation of weapons
systems will be developed in Ada83--i.e., they will not be able to take
advantage of any of the newer Ada-9X capabilities.  Since AI capabilities are
being put into systems today, what is the near-term effect of doing this in
Ada83 v. Ada-9X?  What are the long-term effects--i.e., efficiency,
maintenance, obsolete protocols, etc.--of this delay?<p>

Some "100% Ada" projects are using Ada as "just another language", to be loaded
into a separate address space on a classical operating system with multiple
address spaces.  Any synchronization between the separate address spaces is
implemented by means of non-Ada capabilities--e.g., locking in a "file" system.
The  Ada strong typing system is side-stepped by reading and writing to
external "files".  Worst of all, Ada run-time checks within an "application"
(i.e., address space) are disabled, with any protection provided by the
hardware--e.g., "bus error".  Do such system designs conform to the spirit, as
well as the letter, of the Ada law, or are they a pragmatic solution to an
inflexible language standard?  Perhaps such systems recognize the inevitable
need to interface Ada with COTS technologies--most likely C, C++ or even
Lisp(!).<p>

Issues of ancillary standards and tools.  Are the MIL-STD's for software
design, documentation, implementation and testing appropriate for AI programs,
or are they too rigid?  Can the complex notions of AI programs even be
expressed in these "design methodologies" and "design tools", or are new
methodologies and tools required.  Do the proposed documentation and coding
standards put the AI programmer into a straight-jacket (assuming that Ada
itself hasn't already)?  Are the APSE/KAPSE/... tools part of the solution, or
part of the problem?<p>

Are real-time AI programs a mirage?  Can an AI program ever be expected to
always respond within a fixed latency, or must we start planning for only
stochastic response latencies?  What sorts of scheduling capabilities do AI
programs require beyond those useful for other real-time programs?

<h2>Overall Goal of Workshop and Summary</h2>

Potential contractor/developers of defense software systems have little
incentive to make investments in standards or tools for the uncertain
likelihood of future contracts.  Since AI capabilities are new, there is no
established pool of experience in the defense software contracting industry
which can fight for the language changes and tools which will make AI
programming easier, cheaper and more effective.  There are, on the other hand,
major established groups to argue for better signal processing support, better
decimal/mainframe support, better network support, better real-time support for
traditional software control loops, etc.  It is therefore likely that
significant "holes" exist in the Ada language and infrastructure, which will
only become evident later, when projects become late and costs balloon.<p>

The overall goal of this workshop is a document which clearly states the
requirements for programming languages to support <u>real-time embedded AI
programs for defense applications</u>.  These requirements need to be
prioritized, and the consequences and costs of not meeting the requirements
need to be estimated.  Since modern warfare puts the ultimate premium on
up-to-date intelligence, efficient resource allocation, and pin-point accuracy,
AI will play a pivotal role in making sure that the weapons are located at the
right place and the right time, and used against the right target with the
appropriate ammunition with sufficient accuracy and concentration to knock out
the target once, but only once.  We have to make sure that we are fighting the
<i>next</i> war rather than the <i>previous</i> war.
