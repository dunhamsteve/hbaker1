When translating software from other languages into Ada, it is necessary to
translate foreign identifiers into Ada names.  If the foreign language provides
a richer syntax for identifiers than Ada--e.g., it allows non-alphanumeric
characters--then some encoding scheme will be required in order to provide a
readable 1-1 mapping.  Schemes for achieving such 1-1 mappings are discussed.

Mappings of this sort could be useful in automatic translators which convert
C/C++ header "<tt>.h</tt>" files into Ada, as well as for translators of
high-level design and/or specification languages into Ada.

<h2>
1.  Introduction
</h2>

During the translation of programs written in other languages into Ada, it
becomes necessary to translate foreign identifiers into Ada identifiers.  For a
small program, an <i>ad hoc</i> approach will work, but for larger programs
some automatic method must be used, or else the translator will run the risk of
inadvertent name collisions.  An automatic method has the additional advantage
that the translator need no longer be imaginative, and translation productivity
will therefore be enhanced.<p>

If the translation into Ada is being performed by an automatic tool, it is
essential that its algorithm for identifier translations produce names which do
not collide with each other, with Ada reserved words, or with usual Ada
names.<p>

Although there have been several papers about translators of other languages
into Ada [Albrecht80] [Wallis85] [Kaelbling86a,b], there has been little
discussion of the particular problem of identifier translation.  One must
presume that the users of such translators were willing to put up with
incomprehensible names, or were able to utilize relatively simple <i>ad hoc</i>
schemes--e.g., Fortran-77 identifiers, which consist of 1-6 uppercase
alphanumeric characters starting with an uppercase letter, map trivially<a
href="#fn1">[1]</a> into Ada names [ANSI-Fortran].<p>

Nimble Computer Corporation has developed an automatic translator from the
Common Lisp programming language into Ada [Baker89], and hence has faced the
problem of mechanically translating Common Lisp identifiers--called
"symbols"--into Ada.  As Common Lisp symbols have spellings which consist of
completely arbitrary character strings, it became necessary to devise a 1-1
mapping from ASCII strings into legal Ada identifiers.  However, although a
hexadecimal mapping of "<tt>Hello</tt>" into <tt>X_48_65_6C_6C_6F</tt> is
simple and straightforward, it is also completely unreadable, and thus makes
for a poor quality translation of Common Lisp into Ada.  We discuss mappings
which are both 1-1, and also readable.

<h2>
2.  Ada Identifiers
</h2>

Ada identifiers are used both as names and as reserved words [AdaLRM, 2.3/1,
2.9/2].  Ada identifiers have the following syntax: <tt>letter {[underline]
letter_or_digit}</tt> [AdaLRM, 2.3/2].  In other words, Ada names: 1) must be
comprised of letters, digits and underlines; 2) must start with a letter; 3)
must not end with an underline; 4) must not have adjacent underlines; and 5)
must not be one of the 63 reserved words.<a href="#fn2">[2]</a>
Furthermore, Ada identifiers cannot be longer than one line, because "the end
of line is always a separator" [AdaLRM, 2.2/3]; e.g., we are familiar with one
validated Ada compiler which has a line length limitation (and hence an
identifier length limitation) of 200 characters.  Finally, Ada does not
distinguish the alphabetic case of letters--i.e., the case of identifiers is
usually normalized to upper case in Ada formatters ("pretty printers") and in
the <tt>'IMAGE</tt> attribute of enumerated types (Ada does, however, preserve
the case of individually quoted enumerated characters--e.g., <tt>'a'</tt>).

<a href="#fn3">[3]</a>

<h2>
3.  Desirable Characteristics of String-to-Identifier Mappings
</h2>

Below, we list a number of desirable characteristics of any
string-to-identifier mappings:

<ol>

<li>The <i>range</i> of any mapping must be the set of legal Ada
identifiers--i.e., only letters, digits and underlines, first character a
letter, last character a letter or digit, and no adjacent underlines.</li>

<li>No string may map into any Ada reserved word--e.g., no string should map
into the Ada reserved word <tt><b>ACCEPT</b></tt>, etc.</li>

<li>The mapping must be 1-1--i.e., for no two strings s1!=s2, should
<i>m</i>(s1)=<i>m</i>(s2), for any mapping <i>m</i>.  In applying this
restriction, we understand that the "=" compares identifiers the same way that
an Ada compiler does--by ignoring alphabetic case.</li>

<li>The mapping should be approximately homomorphic with respect to
length--i.e., if <i>l</i>(s1)~<i>l</i>(s2), then
<i>l</i>(<i>m</i>(s1))~<i>l</i>(<i>m</i>(s2)).  In other words, very short
strings should not map to very long identifiers, nor should very long strings
map to very short identifiers.</li>

<li>The mapping should be straightforwardly and locally computable in both
directions--i.e., the inverse mapping <i>m</i>^(-1), which exists because
<i>m</i> is 1-1, should be easy to compute.</li>

<li>The mapping should be readable and intuitive, so that it may be computed by
inspection.</li>

</ol>

<h2>
4.  Morphology of Lisp Symbol Names
</h2>

Since our primary purpose in translating strings into Ada names is translating
Common Lisp

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">[Steele90]</a>

symbol names, we review the typical structure of Common Lisp symbol
names.<p>

Although any Common Lisp string may be used to name a Common Lisp symbol, the
most common symbols have alphanumeric names, which look very similar to the
identifiers used by other programming languages.  In particular, most standard
Common Lisp symbols consist of alphanumeric characters which are punctuated
with a hyphen, rather than the underline beloved by Ada and C.  Thus, although
underline is a legitimate character in a Lisp symbol, the hyphen is
traditionally preferred by Lisp programmers for intra-symbol delimitation.
Examples of standard Lisp symbols are <tt>array-element-type</tt> and
<tt>double-float-negative-epsilon</tt>.<p>

Common Lisp symbols may also contain other non-alphabetic characters, however.
For example, the usual arithmetic/logical operators <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>,
<tt>*</tt>, <tt>/</tt>, <tt>=</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>/=</tt>, etc., are all
normal Lisp symbols.  Furthermore, non-alphanumeric characters and normal
characters may be intermixed--e.g., <tt>char&lt;</tt>, <tt>string&gt;=</tt>,
<tt>&amp;rest</tt>.  In particular, most variables with global scope are given
names with surrounding asterisks--e.g., <tt>*standard-output*</tt>.<p>

A naming convention that Common Lisp shares with older languages like Fortran
and Ada is case-insensitivity.  For example, the spelling of the Lisp symbol
<tt>min</tt> is the string <tt>"MIN"</tt>--i.e., the spelling is normalized to
upper case.  The symbol whose spelling is <tt>"min"</tt> can be typed in as
<tt>\m\i\n</tt> or <tt>|min|</tt>,

<a href="#fn4">[4]</a>

but the unadorned <tt>min</tt> means the upper case spelling
"<tt>MIN</tt>".<p>

Due to this preferred usage, the most readable mappings of Lisp symbols to Ada
names will substitute underlines for hyphens, and will preserve the
alphanumeric subsequences within the spelling of the symbol.

<h2>
5.  Developing a Readable Mapping
</h2>

We will develop a readable mapping from strings into Ada names by starting from
a simple mapping, and then elaborate it until it can handle the complete range
of strings.<p>

The most obvious mapping of uppercase alphanumeric strings with an initial
letter is the identity mapping--e.g., <tt>plus</tt> becomes <tt>PLUS</tt>.
This mapping is short, computable and obvious, but it cannot cope with the wide
variety of actual strings, nor can it be extended in any way.  Furthermore, it
makes no provision for avoiding Ada reserved words, many of which are commonly
used Lisp symbols.<p>

A more extensible mapping scheme incorporates a standard prefix and/or suffix
to distinguish mapped symbols from Ada reserved words.  A typical prefix might
be "<tt>S_</tt>", meaning "Symbol", followed by the mapped characters
themselves.  This mapping scheme maps the symbol <tt>accept</tt> into the Ada
identifier <tt>S_ACCEPT</tt>, which is not the same as the identifier
<tt>ACCEPT</tt>, and therefore avoids collisions with reserved words.  Although
the mapping of non-reserved words like <tt>plus</tt> into <tt>S_PLUS</tt>
instead of the more elegant <tt>PLUS</tt> is unfortunate, this prefix scheme
has the advantage of uniformity and isolation from additions to Ada's set of
reserved words.<p>

The prefix and/or suffix schemes also have the advantage of allowing for
extensions over time to the basic mapping scheme--e.g., different prefixes can
represent mappings for different languages.<p>

So far, we can map only uppercase alphanumeric symbols into Ada identifiers
without fear of collisions with Ada reserved words.  We still cannot handle the
hyphenated words typical of Lisp symbols, nor can we handle non-alphanumeric
characters like "&lt;" or "=".<p>

We could make the straight-forward replacement of the hyphen "<tt>-</tt>" by
the underline "<tt>_</tt>", but such a replacement would lose the distinction
between the symbols <tt>abc-def</tt> and <tt>abc_def</tt>, and make an illegal
Ada identifier from the symbol <tt>abc--def</tt>.  We therefore require a more
sophisticated replacement rule.<p>

We consider the hyphen "<tt>-</tt>" in Lisp symbols and the underline
"<tt>_</tt>" in Ada identifiers to separate explicitly delimited
<i>syllables</i> from one another.  We will therefore use the explicit hyphen
"<tt>-</tt>" to parse Lisp symbol names into a list of non-empty syllables
which will then be translated more-or-less separately and then concatenated
together with the Ada syllable underline delimiter "<tt>_</tt>".  If we ignore,
for the moment, the problem of adjacent hyphens and final hyphens, then we
achieve the reasonable mapping of the symbol <tt>output-file</tt> into
<tt>S_OUTPUT_FILE</tt> and the symbol <tt>find-if-not </tt>into
<tt>S_FIND_IF_NOT</tt>.<p>

We must now deal with the problem of symbols like <tt>char&lt;=</tt>.  This
symbol is usually pronounced as "char less than or equal" or "char less equal",
so if we take our cue from the symbol's pronunciation, we should map this
symbol into something like <tt>S_CHAR_LESS_EQUAL</tt>.  Such a mapping requires
that each non-alphanumeric character be considered its own syllable, which is
translated independently of the other syllables.  If we extend this idea, then
we must define names for all of the non-alphanumeric characters, as the
following table illustrates.  However, to minimize collisions with user-defined
syllables, the names for the non-alphanumeric characters should <i>not</i> be
real English words, but some contracted form of a name for the character--e.g.,
<tt>DLLR</tt> rather than <tt>DOLLAR</tt>.  The use of contraction allows the
reader to understand the syllable, but also reminds him that the syllable is
not a literal syllable, but represents a single character.<a

</pre></tt>

Using this table, we can now map mixed symbols like <tt>string/=</tt> into
<tt>S_STRING_SLSH_EQUL</tt>.  Unfortunately, this symbol now collides with the
mapped symbol <tt>string-slsh-equl</tt>, so we must somehow distinguish the
two.  Since <tt>string/=</tt> occurs more frequently than
<tt>string-slsh-equl</tt> (probably because <tt>string/=</tt> is usually
pronounced "string not equal"), we would like to map <tt>string/=</tt> into
<tt>S_STRING_SLSH_EQUL</tt>, and then choose a longer mapping for the symbol
<tt>string-slash-equal</tt>.<p>

In the best of all possible worlds, we would utilize doubled underlines
"<tt>__</tt>" to distinguish alphanumeric syllables which actually occur from
those which are mapped from characters.  Unfortunately, these double underlines
are illegal in Ada (sigh!).  We must therefore choose a more devious scheme
which is consistent with the English language.  Since the letter "<tt>q</tt>"
is rarely used in English at all, and then even more rarely without the letter
"<tt>u</tt>" succeeding, we will indicate actually occurring syllables which
collide with our table entries with a prefix of "<tt>QQ_</tt>", for "quote".
In other words, we will map the symbol <tt>string-slsh-equl</tt> into
<tt>S_STRING_QQ_SLSH_QQ_EQUL</tt>.  Since the syllable after the "<tt>QQ_</tt>"
is treated literally, any syllable which actually is "<tt>qq</tt>" is simply
prefixed with another "<tt>QQ_</tt>" so the mapping is 1-1.  For example, the
symbol <tt>string-qq=</tt> is mapped into <tt>S_STRING_QQ_QQ_EQUL</tt>.<p>

Now that we have the "<tt>QQ</tt>" mechanism for quoting syllables, we can
eliminate the initial "<tt>S_</tt>" prefix from most symbols, and more
uniformly utilize "<tt>QQ_</tt>" prefixes on those identifiers whose first
syllable requires quoting--e.g., any Ada reserved word; <tt>accept</tt> thus
becomes <tt>QQ_ACCEPT</tt>.  In the unlikely event that the Lisp code uses the
symbol <tt>qq-accept</tt>, it will map to <tt>QQ_QQ_ACCEPT</tt>.<p>

We now take up the problem we deferred above--i.e., the problem of doubled and
final hyphens.  This problem is easily solved by treating all hyphens in a
multiple-hyphen sequence, except for the first one, as separate
single-character syllables, to be encoded separately according to the table
which now requires an additional entry: "<tt>-</tt>" is mapped to
"<tt>MNS</tt>".  Furthermore, a final hyphen is also treated as a separate
one-character syllable.  Thus, the single-hyphen symbol "<tt>-</tt>" is mapped
into <tt>MNS</tt>, the two-hyphen symbol "<tt>--</tt>" is mapped into
<tt>MNS_MNS</tt>, the three-hyphen symbol "<tt>---</tt>" is mapped into
<tt>MNS_MNS_MNS</tt>, the symbol <tt>abc-def</tt> is mapped into
<tt>ABC_DEF</tt>, the symbol <tt>abc--def</tt> is mapped into
<tt>ABC_MNS_DEF</tt>, and the symbol <tt>abc-def-</tt> is mapped into
<tt>ABC_DEF_MNS</tt>.<p>

The final problem to be solved is that of lower case symbols like
<tt>\f\o\o</tt> (or <tt>|foo|</tt>).  Actually, we have several problems--the
problem of whole lower-case syllables, the problem of a syllable with an
initial uppercase letter followed by lower case alphanumerics, and the problem
of isolated lower-case letters.  Common Lisp itself provides for an isolated
lower case letter via the single-character quoting mechanism of "\", and
retains the ability to quote an entire string using vertical bars, as above.
Unfortunately, we must both quote and translate, since we cannot represent
non-alphanumeric characters.  Extending the mechanism suggested above, we can
map an entire lower-case syllable through a "<tt>QQL_</tt>" (quote lower-case)
prefix, or map a syllable with an initial upper-case letter through a
"<tt>QQD_</tt>" (quote 1 character, then down-case) prefix.  Finally, the case
of the single isolated lower-case character can be handled by treating it as a
separate syllable, and providing it with a default mapping in the character
mapping table--e.g., the single lower-case letter "<tt>a</tt>" could be mapped
to a separate syllable "<tt>LCA</tt>".

<h2>
6.  Examples and Discussion
</h2>

We have shown a reasonably readable encoding method for translating Lisp symbol
names into legal Ada names which is both 1-1 and readable.  Here are some
examples:

<tt><pre>
i,n				I,N
character, integer		CHARACTER, INTEGER
array, null			QQ_ARRAY, QQ_NULL            (Ada reserved words)
let, let*			LET, LET_STR
*standard-output*		STR_STANDARD_OUTPUT_STR
&amp;allow-other-keys		AMPR_ALLOW_OTHER_KEYS
*, **				STR, STR_STR
-, --				MNS, MNS_MNS
1+, 1-				QQ_1_PLS, QQ_1_MNS     (1st char. non-alphabetic)
&lt;, &gt;				LSS, GRT
=, /=, &lt;=, &gt;=			EQUL, SLSH_EQUL, LSS_EQUL, GRT_EQUL
char&lt;, char&lt;=			CHAR_LSS, CHAR_LSS_EQUL
|hello|, |Hello|, hel\lo	QQL_HELLO, QQD_HELLO, HEL_LCL_O
()				LPAR_RPAR            (a spelling for Lisp's nil!)
</pre></tt>

Our scheme handles the 700-odd standard<a href="#fn6">[6]</a>
symbols of Common Lisp, and represents most user symbols in a moderately
readable fashion.  Due to the implicit length limitation of Ada symbols, some
excessively long Lisp symbols may not be mappable, but since most long Lisp
symbols are hyphenated English phrases, these will usually map into Ada names
of the same length.<p>

Some of these ideas should also be useful in the conversion of identifiers from
non-Lisp languages into Ada, since the identifiers of these languages are more
constrained, and hence easier to map into Ada.  In particular, Ada programs
which must interface with C and C++ programs--e.g., MIT's X-Windows and
Microsoft Windows--have found the need to automatically translate C/C++ header
"<tt>.h</tt>" files into Ada, and such translators could utilize some of the
strategies suggested here.<p>

Finally, these techniques may also be useful for the automatic mapping of other
kinds of object names into Ada--e.g., in CAD/CASE tools, such as high level
"specification" languages which incorporate Ada code generators.
