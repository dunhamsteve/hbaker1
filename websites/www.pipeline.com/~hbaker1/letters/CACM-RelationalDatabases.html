Dear ACM Forum:<br></p>

<p>I had great difficulty in controlling my mirth while I read the
self-congratulatory article "Database Systems: Achievements and
Opportunities" in the October, 1991, issue of the
<cite>Communications,</cite> because its authors consider
<em>relational databases</em> to be one of the three major
achievements of the past two decades.  As a designer of commercial
manufacturing applications on IBM mainframes in the late 1960's and
early 1970's, I can categorically state that relational databases
<em>set the commercial data processing industry back at least ten
years</em> and wasted many of the billions of dollars that were spent
on data processing.  With the recent arrival of object-oriented
databases, the industry may finally achieve some of the promises which
were made 20 years ago about the capabilities of computers to automate
and improve organizations.</p>

</p>Biological systems follow the rule "ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny", which states that every higher-level organism goes through
a developmental history which mirrors the evolutionary development of
the species itself.  Data processing systems seem to have followed the
same rule in perpetuating the Procrustean bed of the "unit record".
Virtually all commercial applications in the 1960's were based on
<em>files</em> of fixed-length <em>records</em> of multiple
<em>fields,</em> which were <em>selected</em> and <em>merged.</em>
Codd's relational theory dressed up these concepts with the trappings
of mathematics (wow, we lowly Cobol programmers are now
<em>mathematicians!</em>)  by calling files <em>relations,</em>
records <em>rows,</em> fields <em>domains,</em> and merges
<em>joins.</em>  To a close approximation, established data processing
<em>practise</em> became database <em>theory</em> by simply renaming
all of the concepts.  Because "algebraic relation theory" was much
more respectible than "data processing", database theoreticians could
now get tenure at respectible schools whose names did not sound like
the "Control Data Institute".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, relational databases performed a task that didn't
need doing; e.g., these databases were orders of magnitude slower than
the "flat files" they replaced, and they could not begin to handle the
requirements of real-time transaction systems.  In mathematical
parlance, they made trivial problems obviously trivial, but did
nothing to solve the really hard data processing problems.  In fact,
the advent of relational databases made the hard problems harder,
because the application engineer now had to convince his non-technical
management that the relational database had no clothes.</p>

<p>Why were relational databases such a Procrustean bed?  Because
organizations, budgets, products, etc., are hierarchical; hierarchies
require transitive closures for their "explosions"; and transitive
closures cannot be expressed within the classical Codd model using
only a finite number of joins (I wrote a paper in 1971 discussing this
problem).  Perhaps this sounds like 20-20 hindsight, but most
manufacturing databases of the late 1960's were of the "Bill of
Materials" type, which today would be characterized as
"object-oriented".  Parts "explosions" and budgets "explosions" were
the norm, and these databases could easily handle the complexity of
large amounts of CAD-equivalent data.  These databases could also
respond quickly to "real-time" requests for information, because the
data was readily accessible through pointers and hash tables--without
performing "joins".</p>

<p>I shudder to think about the large number of man-years that were
devoted during the 1970's and 1980's to "optimizing" relational
databases to the point where they could remotely compete in the
marketplace.  It is also a tribute to the power of the universities,
that by teaching only relational databases, they could convince an
entire generation of computer scientists that relational databases
were more appropriate than "ad hoc" databases such as flat files and
Bills of Materials.</p>

<p>Computing history will consider the past 20 years as a kind of Dark
Ages of commercial data processing in which the religious zealots of
the Church of Relationalism managed to hold back progress until a
Renaissance rediscovered the Greece and Rome of pointer-based
databases.  Database research has produced a number of good results,
but the relational database is not one of them.</p>
