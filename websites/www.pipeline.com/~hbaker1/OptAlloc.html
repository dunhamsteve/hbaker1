<h2>Space Management Problems</h2>

</head><body>

MACLISP, unlike some other implementations of LISP, allocates storage for
different types of objects in noncontiguous areas called <i>spaces</i>.  These
spaces partition the active storage into disjoint areas, each of which holds a
different type of object.  For example, <i>list cells</i> are stored in one
space, <i>full-word integers</i> reside in another space, <i>full-word floating
point numbers</i> in another, and so on.<p>

Allocating space in this manner has several advantages.  An object's type can
easily be computed from a pointer to it, without any memory references to the
object itself.  Thus, the LISP primitive <tt>ATOM(x) </tt>can easily compute
its result without even paging in <tt>x</tt>.  Another advantage is that the
type of an object does not require any storage within the object, so that
arithmetic with hardware data types such as full-word integers can use hardware
instructions directly.<p>

There are problems associated with this method of storage and type management,
however.  When all data types are allocated from the same heap, there is no
problem with varying demand for the different data types; all data types
require storage from the same pool, so that only the total amount of storage is
important.  Once different data types must be allocated from different spaces,
however, the relative sizes of the spaces becomes important.<p>

We would like to find optimal policies for deciding in what ratios the spaces
should be allocated so that garbage collection is minimized.  Suppose, for
example, that a program is in an equilibrium situation, where the rate of
storage allocation for each data type is equal to the rate of garbage
generation for that data type.  Suppose further that the rate r1 for data type
1 is twice the rate r2 of data type 2, and that the number of free words in
both spaces is the same.  Then the program will continually run out of data
type 1 before data type 2.  Suppose now that we halve the free words in space
2.  The user program will now run out of both kinds equally often, Furthermore,
the timing and amount of garbage collection will be the same as before because
the additional free words in space 2 were never used.<p>

This analysis gives the key to optimal allocation for an equilibrium situation:
balance the free storage for each data type against the rate of use of that
data type.  In other words, make all spaces run out of free words at the same
time.<p>

The calculation of optimal space size is now simple algebra.  Let:

<ul>

<li>ri be the rate of word usage for data type i;</li>

<li>Fi be the free words available for data type i;</li>

<li>F be the free words available to all data types.</li>

</ul>

Then for optimal allocation,<p>

Fi = (ri/(sum over j of rj))*F

<h2>Intelligent Allocation</h2>

The question now is: "How can the rate of free storage usage for each data type
be measured?" A "cons-counter" could be implemented for each data type, which
would count the cells allocated for that data type, but in MACLISP this
measurement is better made by the garbage collector.  The <tt>gc-daemon</tt>
interrupt, which is triggered by each garbage collection, invokes the
<tt>gc-daemon</tt> with an argument which associates with each space four
quantities: the number of words free and the size of that space, both before
and after the garbage collection.  This information, together with the
information from the <tt>gc-daemon</tt> argument at the previous garbage
collection, allows us to calculate the average rates of free storage usage for
each space since the last garbage collection.  This information allows us to
use the <tt>ALLOC</tt> function to reallocate free storage to each space in
proportion to its usage.<p>

PDP-10 MACLISP presents another problem when reallocating.  Since it does not
use a compacting garbage collector, the spaces can he expanded, but never
contracted.  Therefore, the <tt>gc-daemon</tt> must be conservative in its
reallocation strategy, because it can not back down on an allocation.<p>

Suppose that we wish to achieve an overall garbage collection efficiency of m
words allocated to each word traced.  This means that if the total storage used
by accessible structures consists of T words, then we wish to have (1+m)*T words
allocated to the various spaces, in total.  In other words, F=m*T words are free
and should be divided among the spaces for their free areas.  Now we have
determined that the free storage for each space should be proportional to the
rate of storage allocation in that space.  Therefore,<p>

Fi = (ri/(sum over j of rj))*m*T<p>

Now since spaces can be expanded but not contracted, we need only make sure
that space i has <i>at least</i> Fi free words.  This is achieved through the
<tt>gcsize</tt>, <tt>gcmax</tt>, and <tt>gcmin</tt> parameters of
<tt>ALLOC</tt>.<p>

In MACLISP, one can communicate one's intentions with regard to the management
of a space to the system by calling a function <tt>ALLOC</tt> with the space
name and 3 parameters.  The <tt>gcsize</tt> parameter specifies how large the
space is allowed to grow before the garbage collector is called.
<tt>Gcmax</tt> specifies the maximum size the space may grow to before
triggering the <tt>gc-overflow</tt> interrupt.  Finally, <tt>gcmin</tt>
specifies how much of the space should be free after performing a garbage
collection; if the free storage is less than <tt>gcmin</tt>, the garbage
collector immediately allocates more storage to the space.  (<tt>Gcmin</tt> may
be specified as either an absolute number of words or a percentage).<p>

We will make use in our <tt>gc-daemon</tt> of only the <tt>gcsize</tt>
allocation parameters of each space.  <tt>Gcmin</tt> will be set to 0 (or as
small as possible), and <tt>gcmax</tt> will be set to infinity (or as large as
possible).  We ignore <tt>gcmin</tt> because the garbage collector uses it to
to allocate space before the <tt>gc-daemon</tt> has had a chance to think
things over.  Setting <tt>gcmin</tt> instead of <tt>gcsize</tt> would mean that
any decision by the daemon would not take effect until after the next garbage
collection, which would greatly reduce the responsiveness of the
<tt>gc-daemon</tt> to the current situation.

<h2>The Garbage Collection Deamon</h2>

The <tt>gc-daemon</tt> needs to be able to calculate two quantities for every
space--the current number of accessible words and the gross number of words
allocated since the last garbage collection.  The current number of accessible
words for a space can easily be calculated by subtracting the number of words
free at the end of the current garbage collection from the size of the space at
that time.  The gross number of words allocated since the previous garbage
collection can be calculated as the difference between the number in use at the
beginning of the current garbage collection(size before minus free before) and
the number accessible at the end of the previous garbage collection.<p>

With these figures calculated for each space, it is easy to calculate the total
number of accessible words and the differential rates of allocation.  Taking
the total free storage to be a percentage of the total accessible storage, we
can divide up this free space among the spaces based on their differential
rates of allocation.  MACLISP is informed of this decision by setting the
<tt>gcsize</tt> of each space to the sum of the accessible cells in that space
plus the new free storage allotment just calculated.  (We also round
<tt>gcsize</tt> up to the next multiple of 512 because 512 words is the
smallest unit of allocation in MACLISP).<p>

The system could be improved by varying the allocate/mark ratio as the total
number of accessible words grew.  The idea is to garbage collect more to keep
the working-set size small.  However, since the paging depends so heavily on
the current operating system load, one would need information from the
operating system to make that decision properly.<p>

The <tt>gc-daemon</tt> tries to divide up the free storage among the various
spaces based on their relative allocation histories.  This strategy hopes that
the future will be like the near past(since the previous garbage collection).
However, in practice, programs go through phases, with one phase requiring a
drastically different mix of cell types than another.  Therefore the
<tt>gc-daemon</tt> can be wrong.  Since the costs of misallocation are larger
with the larger spaces, and since storage can never be retracted from a space
once allocated, the <tt>gc-daemon</tt> may wish to hedge its bets by giving the
larger spaces only partial allocations.<p>

A <tt>gc-daemon</tt> having the characteristics described above is presented
below in V. Pratt's CGOL input notation for LISP.  This daemon stores all the
information about a space on the property list of that space's name.  For
example, the normalized rate of list consing can be accessed by <tt>(GET 'LIST
'ALLOCRATE)</tt>.  Summary information is stored on the property list of
<tt>TOTAL-STORAGE</tt>.  The only user-settable parameter is the variable
<tt>ALLOCMARKRATIO</tt>.  This value must be a positive floating point number
less than 5.0.  It is set initially to 1.0.  Making it smaller decreases
working set size and increases garbage collection time.
