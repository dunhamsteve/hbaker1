Generation-based garbage collection has been advocated by appealing to the
intuitive but vague notion that "young objects are more likely to die than old
objects".  The intuition is, that if a generation-based garbage collection
scheme focuses its effort on scanning recently created objects, then its
scanning efforts will pay off more in the form of more recovered garbage, than
if it scanned older objects.  In this note, we show a counterexample of a
system in which "infant mortality" is as high as you please, but for which
generational garbage collection is ineffective for improving the average
mark/cons ratio.  Other benefits, such as better locality and a smaller number
of large delays, may still make generational garbage collection attractive for
such a system, however.

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

In the decade since generational garbage collection was first proposed in print
[Lieberman and Hewitt 83], a number of papers (including some of my own) have
introduced their discussions of generational garbage collection by statements
such as "between 80 and 98 percent of all newly-allocated objects die within a
few million instructions", or "most newly created cells die young".  While this
intuition is sometimes backed up by measurements which "prove" the
effectiveness of a particular generational scheme, there are very few
theoretical models by which we can reasonably compare one generational scheme
with another, or with non-generational schemes.<p>

We show via a counterexample that the quoted statements above are essentially
meaningless, because a meaningful discussion of age-based garbage collection
schemes requires the presentation of significantly more data in the form of
complete object lifetime probability density functions, rather than the one or
two data points usually proffered.

<h2>
Generational Garbage Collection
</h2>

Traditional non-generational tracing garbage collection schemes require time
for a single collection which is proportional to the number of cells still in
use, with an additional (usually negligible) term proportional to the total
amount of storage under management.  Depending upon the time between such
"full" garbage collections, one may allocate a large number of cells and then
recover a large number of garbage cells at the end of the collection.  Thus, to
a first-order approximation, the cost of this traditional garbage collection
scheme per cell allocated is proportional to the "mark/cons" ratio--the more
marking we perform per cell allocated, the lower the fraction of execution time
will be spent marking, but the larger the total amount of space will be
required to support N live cells.<p>

Generational garbage collection schemes attempt to take advantage of the
intuition that "most cells that die, die young" by separating the objects into
different categories based on their age; these categories are called
<i>generations</i>.  If the intuition is correct, and if most tracing/marking
can be focussed on the younger generations, then the categorical schemes can
achieve a lower average amount of tracing/marking work per object allocated and
thereby achieve a net performance advantage over a non-categorical collector
[DeTreville77].  In addition to these first-order savings, one can also achieve
second-order savings of increased locality in the memory hierarchy because the
more localized tracing work is less likely to disrupt the residence of live
objects in the faster memories/caches.<p>

To summarize, generational garbage collection has been advocated for at least
three reasons:<p>

<ul>

<li>generational garbage collection can reduce the mark/cons ratio in some
applications</li>

<li>generational GC can improve the locality of reference over a
non-generational GC</li>

<li>generational GC has many small pauses instead of a few large pauses</li>

</ul>

<h2>
"Radioactive Decay" Model of Object Lifetimes
</h2>

Let us consider an application whose objects die through a process analogous to
the radioactive decay process found in unstable physical isotopes.  (An
application with these characteristics may not be prototypical of
garbage-collected applications, but it does provide an ideal mathematical model
which can represent one end of a spectrum.)  In such a process, the probability
of any particular object decaying within a particular period of time is related
to the length of the period, but not to the particular particle, or to the
existing age of the particle.  In particular, such a process is oblivious to
the age already achieved by a particle, but depends solely upon whether it has
already "decayed".  Such a decay process has but one parameter--its "half life"
<i>tau</i>, which is the period of time during which half of its particles can be
expected to decay, and therefore the number of particles likely to decay in any
short period of time is proportional to the number of undecayed particles still
left.  Thus, if N0 is the number of particles at t=0, then the expected number
of particles still undecayed at any time t&gt;0 is a simple negative
exponential function N0*2^(-t/<i>tau</i>).<p>

Now consider such an application in which new particles are continually being
added/created at the same rate that particles are decaying.  The average number
of particles is then constant over time.<a href="#fn1">[2]</a>
In this situation, the same propensity of an object to die independent of its
achieved lifetime still holds.  In such a radioactive-like system, one will
find it true that "most objects die young", and for any <i>single</i>
measurement of the form "only 2% of the objects survived 1 second", it is
trivial to compute a "half life" consistent with this observation--i.e.,
<i>tau</i>=177 msec.<p>

However, if one attempts to utilize a generational garbage collector for this
application, one finds that no matter how the generations are chosen, the decay
rate for each generation is proportional to the size of the generation, not to
its age, and therefore, the average mark/cons ratio for each generation is the
same.  For such an application, a generational garbage collector cannot improve
the average mark/cons ratio, and the additional overheads of generational
collection may cause the total amount of work to increase relative to a
non-generational collector.  On the other hand, a generational garbage
collector may show increased locality of reference, and/or better average
response, due to second-order effects.  Thus, it is very important for papers
which provide measurements of garbage collection algorithms to document the
mark/cons ratios, localities and other important parameters, in addition to
total runtime and/or GC load.

<h2>
Conclusions
</h2>

Generational garbage collection can often, within a given amount of storage, 1)
reduce the average mark/cons ratio, 2) improve the locality of reference, and
3) trade a small number of long pauses for many short pauses.  While the
locality of reference improvement and the improved response time are available
across a wide range of applications, a decreased load due to a reduced
mark/cons time is less intuitively realized.  The statistics must be very far
from equilibrium, the overheads of the generational scheme have to be very
small, and the predictions of the generational scheme have to be extremely good
in order to produce any mark/cons benefit relative to a non-generational
collector.  Furthermore, the vague appeals to intuition in the form "most
objects die quickly" can be shown to apply equally well to processes in which
all generations produce exactly the same mark/cons ratios.<p>

In the newest generation of microprocessors which incorporate a significant
amount of cache memory, and for which a cache "miss" may cost more than 100
instructions, the "second order" locality effects of generational garbage
collection may be more important than the "first order" effects of an improved
mark/cons ratio.  For example, our stack-based "lazy allocation" generational
scheme

<a href="LazyAlloc.html">[Baker92]</a>

is highly integrated with the programming language implementation, and
shares most of its work with the existing programming language
parameter-passing and value-returning mechanisms, and therefore avoids
gratuitous non-local behavior.<p>

Our personal belief is that the object lifetimes found in garbage collection
measurements cannot be adequately modelled by traditional
probability/statistics models which assume that distributions have finite
"standard deviations", but will require <i>fractal</i> models [Mandelbrot83],
which can have infinite second moments.

Can't computer scientists come up with less grisly names for these concepts?<p>

<a name="fn1">[2]</a>We consider the simple situation in which a new particle
is added/created <i>exactly</i> when one decays.  The more likely situation in
which only the <i>average rates</i> are equal leads to significant deviations
from the constant number of live particles and to second-order effects,
although the first-order effects are the same.
