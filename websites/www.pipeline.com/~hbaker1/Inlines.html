<h2>
Abstract
</h2>

Many modern programming languages offer a facility for "inlining" designated
procedure and function calls, but this process is not well defined in most
language standards documents.  We offer a model for inlining which has the
property that the resulting code does not depend upon the presentation of the
order of function definitions, and which also provides a finite and consistent
interpretation for the inlining of mutually recursive functions.  Finally, when
used on "tail-recursive" functions, our model of inlining provides for the
equivalent of "loop unrolling".

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

Many programming languages--e.g., Fortran, Ada, C++, Common Lisp--offer a
facility for "macro-expanding" procedure and function calls, so that the
operations of the procedure or function are performed "in line" with the other
operations of the calling procedure rather than being performed "out of line"
within a "closed" subroutine [Allen80] [Harrison77].<p>

The goal of such an integration is to improve execution efficiency.  For very
small subroutines, the overheads of handling arguments and constructing stack
frames can exceed the cost of the operations within the subroutine itself.
With the growing popularity of highly modular programming techniques--e.g.,
"abstract data types"--the percentage of such small procedures has grown
dramatically, and many functions of this sort are often used only to access a
single variable.  Since "inlining" such a subroutine eliminates
function-calling overhead, major performance gains can be obtained
[Scheifler77] [Stroustrup86].<p>

Subroutine inlining (also called "procedure integration") can also open up a
substantial number of additional opportunities for compiler optimizations,
including constant propagation, dead code elimination, etc.  As a result,
inlining even large subroutines can sometimes yield substantial performance
improvements due to effects equivalent to <i>partial evaluation</i> [Ershov77]
[Turchin86].  In particular, entire recursions can be eliminated at compile
time for certain constant arguments if the depth of the recursion is not too
great.<p>

The semantics of inlining ("procedure integration"), however, are usually not
well specified in programming language standards documents.  Perhaps this is
because inlining is not usually thought of as a semantic issue, since whether a
procedure is inlined or not should not change the values that are computed by
the program.  The Ada language [Ada83], for example, considers "inlining" to be
a "pragma", rather than a first-class language element, and therefore leaves
the compiler implementor much flexibility in the actual semantics that it
implements.  C++ [Stroustrup86] considers "inline" to be a "hint" to the
compiler, but does not further specify what this means.  We believe that this
ambiguity can be a source of great confusion, greatly reducing the usefulness
of this important feature.  During the system integration phase of a software
project, for example, the system implementors need to precisely control which
subroutines are inlined, and which are not, so that they may achieve a balance
between running speed and code size.  We therefore propose that the semantics
of procedure inlining be carefully specified to provide intuitive and useful
results in the most common cases.

<h2>
Inlining in Common Lisp<a href="#fn0">[1]</a>
</h2>

Although other programming languages have offered "inlining" services for at
least a decade, Lisp systems have been reticent about providing this
capability.  There are several reasons for this reticence.  First, Lisp has
traditionally offered powerful <i>macros</i>, which provide the programmer with
much of the efficiency that other languages can obtain only through inlining.
Since Lisp macros are strictly more powerful than inlining,<a
href="#fn1">[2]</a> an inlining capability has usually been
considered only as an afterthought.  Secondly, Lisp has traditionally used
dynamically-scoped variables rather than the lexically-scoped variables of
Algol-derivative languages, and traditional Lisp macros already provide (very
nearly) the correct semantics for inlining functions whose internal variables
are all dynamically scoped (!); however, more sophisticated binding environment
and/or renaming schemes are required to preserve the semantics of the
lexically-scoped names of modern Common Lisp during inlining.  Finally, for the
optimization of language-required library functions such as <tt>mapcar</tt>,
Lisp programmers have found mechanisms such as "compiler optimizers" to be more
useful and flexible than simple function inlining.<a
href="#fn2">[3]</a><p>

Due to the availability of a syntax for anonymous functions (including function
closures), the process of inlining in Lisp can be cleanly broken up into two
parts: the replacement of a function name by its anonymous functional value,
and the process of simplifying and optimizing the resulting expression.  It
should be obvious then that the simple process of inlining (i.e., name lookup)
produces by itself only minor savings--the real savings come from the further
simplifications and optimizations which then become possible.  The code below
shows the effect of the name lookup portion of inlining on a simple local
function definition.

<tt><pre>
(flet ((foo (n) &lt;body of foo&gt;)) ;'flet' defines local non-recursive functions.
      (declare (inline foo))    ; command 'foo' to be inlined.
  (......(foo &lt;arg1&gt;) ..... (foo &lt;arg2&gt;) ...))
  ; transforms essentially into
(progn ... ((lambda (n) &lt;body of foo&gt;) &lt;arg1&gt;) ...
           ((lambda (n) &lt;body of foo&gt;) &lt;arg2&gt;) ....)<a href="#fn3">[4]</a>
</pre></tt>

<h2>
Problems in the Semantics of Inlining
</h2>

One of the first problems in the semantics of inlining is whether an inline
declaration/pragma/hint should apply to the <i>definition</i> of the function,
or to an <i>occurrence</i> of its use, or both.  The implication in C++ and Ada
is that if one defines a function to be "inline", then <i>every</i> occurrence
is inlined, and the function definition itself need not appear in the object
code as a normal function, since it is no longer referenced (unless its address
is taken, e.g., by C's <tt>&amp;</tt>).  On the other hand, a programmer might
wish to selectively control inlining on an occurrence-by-occurrence basis,
perhaps by indicating that everywhere within the scope of an <tt>inline</tt>
declaration the occurrences of the function will be inlined.<p>

If one is to specify inlining on an occurrence-by-occurrence basis, then one
may need to somehow warn the compiler to save the source code for a routine, in
case that someone later wants to inline that routine.  For example, Common Lisp
requires the specification of <tt>inline</tt> at both the definition and the
occurrence; the first <tt>inline</tt> tells the compiler to save the function
definition, while the second <tt>inline</tt> tells the compiler to actually
perform the substitution.  The alternative is to cause the compiler to save the
source code for <i>every</i> routine, which may be expensive in memory space
and/or file space, although modern CASE development environments already save
all source code.  An inlining capability interferes with separate compilation
because one may wish to inline a routine whose source code is separately
compiled.  In fact, one may wish to inline a routine whose source code is not
available at all (at least in human-readable form)--e.g., if it is part of a
library purchased from an independent vendor who wishes to protect this source
code.  These issues are identical to those involved in the compilation of Ada
<i>generics</i>, since Ada generics are almost universally treated as
compile-time macros; Ada systems solve this problem by keeping pre-parsed or
raw source text (possibly encrypted) for all routines in a <i>library</i>.<p>

Inlining also interferes with <i>overloading</i>, in that it is difficult to
specify which version of an overloaded function is meant using only the
function name by itself.  Either the current Ada-83 rule must be used, which
specifies that <i>every</i> overloading of the function name must be inlined
when a pragma <tt>inline</tt> specifies the function name, or else one must
specialize the function with a parameter/result <i>signature</i> to
disambiguate which version of the overloaded function is intended to be
inlined.<p>

Both C++ and Ada have the capability of accessing the <i>address</i> of a
function which is given by name.<a href="#fn4">[5]</a>
Therefore, besides the problem of disambiguating an overloaded name, we now
have the additional problem that such an address may not exist if every
occurrence of the function has already been inlined.<p>

Contrary to the standard presumption, inlining in Common Lisp is <i>not</i> a
semantically transparent activity, because a user can easily detect whether a
function has been inlined by modifying the "function cell" of the symbol
denoting the function.  A Common Lisp <tt>inline</tt> declaration, however,
gives the compiler <i>permission</i> to assume that the function cell of the
symbol will be constant throughout the execution of the program.  As a result
of this semantic subtlety, a Common Lisp compiler is cannot simply ignore
<tt>inline</tt>/<tt>notinline</tt> declarations, because these declarations
have semantically significant consequences.<a
href="#fn5">[6]</a><p>

The inlining of a recursive function is not well-defined, since it either
produces an infinite amount of program text, or it is inlined to only one (or
perhaps zero) levels.  Mutually dependent and mutually recursive functions
present additional problems, since it may not be immediately obvious whether
the functions are mutually recursive, and even if they are not mutually
recursive, the order of processing by the compiler may change the meaning of
which occurrences are inlined.<p>

Given a recursive function, there may be reasons for inlining the function to
more than one level of depth.  This process is analogous to the
"loop-unrolling" that is performed in many optimizing compilers for pipelined
and vector architectures [Ellis86], where it is entirely reasonable to unroll a
loop 4 or 8 times.  In fact, if one views "tail-recursion" as isomorphic to
looping, then inlining to a depth of <i>n</i> is equivalent to unrolling the
corresponding loop <i>n</i> times.  While loop unrolling is reasonably
well-defined, the semantics of inlining a recursive subroutine to depth
<i>n</i> is typically not well-defined.

<h2>
Semantical Problems of Inlining
</h2>

Before giving a semantics for inlining, we must first clean up a few minor
problems.<p>

We view the deletion from the object module of inlined procedures which are no
longer referenced as an optional optimization which is more appropriately
handled by a linking loader which notices that there are no references to the
procedure, and hence the procedure need not appear in the executable image.<a
href="#fn6">[7]</a>  We therefore assume that the compiler will
compile every procedure into a normal closed subroutine--even those whose
occurrences are inlined.  By deferring the optimization of eliminating
unreferenced procedures to link time, we eliminate the problem in C++ and Ada
of trying to take the address of a nonexistent procedure.  The mere existence
of a reference to the procedure will cause the linker to include the procedure
in the executable image, where its address can be taken without an error.<a
href="#fn7">[8]</a><p>

We further assume that the compiler and/or development library keeps a copy of
the source code for each function, so that the non-availability of source code
will not be an excuse for refusing to inline a procedure.<a
href="#fn8">[9]</a>  While this may require that a (possibly
encrypted) version of every library routine be available to the compiler, the
mechanics of this process are essentially orthogonal to the semantics of
inlining.

<h2>
Inlining of Definitions
</h2>

We first consider the possibility that "inline" refers to the procedure itself,
rather than to its occurrences.  This means that <i>all</i> occurrences of a
procedure declared "inline" are to be inlined.  We contend that the only
consistent interpretation of this policy is that recursive procedures
(including indirectly recursive procedures) expand into an infinite program
text.<p>

Consider the following sequence of definitions.

<ol>

<li>Declare inline procedure a,b.</li>

<li>Define procedure a.</li>

<li>Define procedure b which calls a.</li>

<li>Define procedure c which calls b.</li>

</ol>

There are several ways a compiler could process these definitions.  The
compiler could either simply attach definitions to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>,
without looking at the program text for these routines.  Then, when defining
<tt>c</tt>, the compiler would expand <tt>b</tt>, and then expand <tt>a</tt>,
yielding a program text for <tt>c</tt> that did not reference either <tt>a</tt>
or <tt>b</tt>.  Alternatively, the compiler could process the definitions of
the inlined procedures while defining them, in order to "speed up" later
expansions of procedures like <tt>c</tt>.  Given the particular sequence here,
either method will work.<p>

Consider, however, the following revised sequence;

<ol>

<li>Declare inline procedure a,b.</li>

<li>Define procedure b which calls a.</li>

<li>Define procedure a.</li>

<li>Define procedure c which calls b.</li>

</ol>

In this case, the scheme which simply binds the unprocessed text for <tt>a</tt>
and <tt>b</tt> would still work properly, while the scheme which attempted to
expand the body of <tt>b</tt> during its definition would still not have access
to the body of <tt>a</tt>, so that a call to <tt>a</tt> would still remain
unexpanded in the body of <tt>c</tt> after <tt>b</tt> has been inlined.<p>

The following order is pessimal:

<ol>

<li>Declare inline procedure a,b.</li>

<li>Define procedure c which calls b.</li>

<li>Define procedure b which calls a.</li>

<li>Define procedure a.</li>

</ul>

Now, neither of the inline bodies are available early enough during the
processing to be actually inlined, so the body of <tt>c</tt> contains
unexpanded calls to <tt>b</tt> which contains an unexpanded call to
<tt>a</tt>.<p>

We can achieve a consistent interpretation, however, by using the following
policy.  We will make two passes through the program.  The first pass will be
used to perform inlining, while the second pass will actually compile the code.
During the first pass, we initialize every inline procedure definition with a
<i>stub</i>.  Then, every inlined procedure <i>occurrence</i> will be replaced
by a pointer to its definition, <u>whether the real definition is known yet or
not</u>.  The definition of a procedure is a text indicating an anonymous
procedure with its parameter and result profile, and its body.  Thus, in the
most recent example, the occurrence of <tt>b</tt> inside the body of <tt>c</tt>
will be replaced by a pointer to the definition of <tt>b</tt>, which will still
be a stub, since <tt>b</tt> has not yet been seen.  However, after both
<tt>b</tt> and <tt>a</tt> have been processed, then the stubs will have been
filled in by real program text.  During the second pass, the compiler will then
the <i>apply</i> the explicit anonymous procedure to the given arguments (a
process call "beta reduction") to complete the inlining.  (There are technical
issues regarding the renaming of certain local "bound variables" in order to
avoid name clashes during these processes.  We do not minimize these problems,
but focus in this paper only on the interpretation of inlined function
names.)<p>

This policy produces a consistent interpretation for all of the inlined
procedures--regardless of the order of their definitions.  However, this
interpretation means that inlined recursive procedures will result in an
infinite amount of program text, because we will have introduced loops into the
program text.  These loops will occur even in the case of mutually recursive
procedures, which are less obviously recursive.  During the second pass, the
compiler will run out of space due to the attempt to create an infinitely long
program.  (This error can be more easily and cheaply diagnosed by an
intermediate pass which detects such loops in the program text.)<p>

We believe that this circular interpretation is forced by tying the concept of
"inlining" to the <i>definition</i> of a procedure rather than to its
<i>occurrence</i>.  The only consistent way to inline <i>every</i> occurrence
is to eliminate every occurrence through substitution and thereby produce
cycles in the program text!<a href="#fn9">[10]</a>

<h2>
Inlining of Occurrences
</h2>

By inlining <i>occurrences</i> rather than <i>definitions</i>, the programmer
is given more flexibility to control inlining, and we can consider the
possibility of inlining certain occurrences of functions which are recursive.
We now need to discuss the issue of the <i>scope</i> of the inline declaration
itself, however, since it no longer coincides with the scope of the definition
of the function.  In particular, we can have a situation where a
<tt>notinline</tt> declaration may <i>shadow</i> an <tt>inline</tt>
declaration, and vice versa.<p>

Suppose that we make the scope of the <tt>inline</tt> declaration similar to
that of a new identifier.  More precisely, suppose that we define a new
function name whose definition happens to coincide with the outer function
definition, except that the new function is guaranteed to be inlined.  Then
within the scope of this new identifier, all occurrences of this function will
be inlined.  Similarly, we can have a <tt>notinline</tt> declaration which will
cause any occurrences within its scope to have an out-of-line calling
sequence.<p>

These semantics can be partially achieved in Common Lisp through the use of
<tt>macrolet</tt> capability for defining lexically-scoped local macros.  The
<tt>inline</tt> version of the program <tt>foo</tt> is achieved through a local
macro which expands into the text of the function, while the <tt>notinline</tt>
version of the program is obtained by a different macro which expands into the
calling sequence <tt>(funcall #'foo &lt;args&gt;)</tt>.  We have only a partial
solution, however, because any bound variables between the original definition
of the function and the occurrence of its name must be "alpha-renamed" in order
to avoid clashes with the free variables of the function being inlined.<p>

Given these semantics, the default for a new procedure definition must be
<tt>notinline</tt>, or else we could never define a recursive procedure.  What
are the semantics when a recursive procedure declares itself to be
<tt>inline</tt> within its own body?  Since the interpretation which causes
circular program text is not very useful, we consider what the other
alternatives might be.  A useful interpretation is the one which allows every
identifier currently within the scope of the declaration to be replaced by
<i>copies</i> of the body, but any identifiers within this copy itself are not
replaced.  In other words, the recursive procedure is to be inlined only <i>one
level</i>.<p>

How can this inlining be mechanized so that only the appropriate identifiers
are replaced with program text?  In other words, how does one avoid the "name
capture" problem that one can get by bringing new occurrences of the function
name itself inside the scope of the <tt>inline</tt> declaration?<p>

Within the recursive definition of the normal (notinline) function <tt>f</tt>,
the occurrences of <tt>f</tt> do <i>not</i> mean the text of <tt>f</tt> itself,
but refer instead to a calling sequence for the out-of-line subroutine
<tt>f</tt>.  Therefore, when the compiler sees these occurrences of <tt>f</tt>,
it does not go into an infinite recursion.<p>

If one chooses the interpretation that the <tt>inline</tt> declaration
introduces a new function name with the same spelling as the outer function
name, then every lexical occurrence of that name will be replaced by a copy of
the text of the function.  Within the text of the function is the
<tt>inline</tt> declaration itself, which will get processed again, however,
and again cause an infinite expansion of the text.  Of course, if there are no
occurrences outside of its definition, then this subprogram will be dropped by
the linking loader, even after consuming an infinite amount of time and space
during compilation!

<h2>
Constraints
</h2>

So far, we have exhibited only problems, not solutions.  Before we sketch a
solution to these problems, we list the constraints we wish to place on any
potential solution.<p>

<ol>

<li><i>The programmer knows what he/she is doing</i>.  In other words,
<tt>inline</tt> and <tt>notinline</tt> declarations are not <i>hints</i>, but
<i>commands</i>.  Our semantics try to provide a finite interpretation for
these commands, but whenever such an interpretation is not possible, the
compiler should complain, rather than quietly ignoring an <tt>inline</tt>
command.</li>

<li>The sequence of a non-recursive function definition followed by an
<tt>inline</tt> declaration, followed by an occurrence of the function name
should cause the name to be replaced by the function definition.</li>

<li>The sequence of a recursive function definition followed by an
<tt>inline</tt> declaration, followed by an occurrence of the function name
should cause the name to be replaced by a finite program text which is
intuitively a "one-level" expansion of the function.</li>

<li>The declaration <tt>(inline-k foo)</tt>, where <tt>k</tt> is a non-negative
constant integer, should have the effect of unrolling a tail-recursive
(iterative) function <tt>foo</tt> exactly <tt>k</tt> times.</li>

</ol>

<h2>
Hint: the lambda-calculus Y operator
</h2>

The <i>lambda calculus</i> [Barendregt84] provides an interesting insight into
the problem of inlining functions.  The lambda calculus does not explicitly
provide for recursive functions, but they can be readily defined using the
<tt>Y</tt> operator [Gabriel88].  The <tt>Y</tt> operator operates on the
"kernel" of a function definition to produce a full-fledged function in which
internal references to the function itself have been properly bound to the
function itself.  The lambda calculus is completely functional, however, and so
it cannot use the means of achieving recursive functions found in traditional
programming language implementations--imperative assignment to create a
circular structure in the compiled text.  Rather, the lambda calculus
<tt>Y</tt> operator expands (inlines) the function <i>lazily</i> as it is
needed, so that it is expanded only to the depth of recursion actually
required, rather than infinitely.

<h2>
Solution #1
</h2>

The hint from the lambda-calculus tells us that we cannot hope to solve our
problem unless we can break the recursive cycles at compile-time and focus on
non-recursive substitutions.  In Common Lisp terminology, this means that we
must somehow translate the <tt>labels</tt> special forms which produce cyclic
binding environments into <tt>flet</tt> or <tt>macrolet</tt> special forms
which produce non-cyclic binding environments.  The translation below achieves
this by moving the cycles from compile-time to run-time:

<tt><pre>
(defmacro labels (fns &amp;body forms)
  (let ((nfnames (mapcar #'(lambda (ignore) (gensym)) fns)))
    `(let ,nfnames
       (macrolet ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f nf &amp;aux (fn (car f)))
                              `(,fn (&amp;rest a) (list* 'funcall ',nf a)))
                          fns nfnames)
         (setq ,@(mapcan #'(lambda (f nf) `(,nf #'(lambda ,@(cdr f))))
                         fns nfnames))
         ,@forms))))
</pre></tt>

Since this definition is inscrutable, we show its effect on a recursive program
for the factorial function:

<tt><pre>
(labels ((fact (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
  (fact 10)) =&gt;

(let (fact-gensym)
  (macrolet ((fact (&amp;rest a) (list* 'funcall 'fact-gensym a)))
    (setq fact-gensym #'(lambda (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
    (fact 10)))
</pre></tt>

The ordering of the forms in the above emulation of <tt>labels</tt> by
<tt>let</tt>, <tt>macrolet</tt> and <tt>setq</tt> is extremely important.  The
run-time lexical variable for holding the recursive function definition must
first be defined without a value; <tt>macrolet</tt> is then used to define a
local lexical macro which simply expands into an out-of-line call to the
function stored in that variable; finally, the cycle is completed at run-time
by an assignment of the function closure to the run-time lexical variable.
Notice that the closure must be defined inside the <tt>macrolet</tt>, since the
closure has occurrences of the function name (<tt>fact</tt>) which reference
the function defined by the <tt>macrolet</tt>.  Since <tt>macrolet</tt> macros
do not appear as recursive functions to the compiler, the meaning of inlining
for the function stub is well-defined.<p>

We must now modify this definition of <tt>labels</tt> to handle the possibility
of an <tt>inline</tt> or <tt>notinline</tt> declaration within any of the
recursively defined functions, or within the body of the <tt>labels</tt>
itself.  We do this by defining two versions for each <tt>labels</tt>-defined
function--both an in-line and an out-of-line version.  Ignoring for the moment
the possibility of name clashes, we define for each <tt>labels</tt> function
<tt>foo</tt> both a <tt>foo-inline</tt> and a <tt>foo-notinline</tt> version.
We then choose which version is to be specified by the simple name <tt>foo</tt>
by surrounding the appropriate text with a <tt>macrolet</tt> which defines
<tt>foo</tt> in terms of either <tt>foo-inline</tt> or <tt>foo-notinline</tt>.
In other words, we utilize a <tt>macrolet</tt> to rename <tt>foo</tt> for us as
either <tt>foo-inline</tt> or <tt>foo-notinline</tt>.

<tt><pre>
(defun inline-name (name) (intern (format nil "~A-INLINE" name)))

(defun notinline-name (name) (intern (format nil "~A-NOTINLINE" name)))

(defmacro flet-inline (fns &amp;body forms)
  `(flet ,fns (declare (inline ,@(mapcar #'car fns))) ,@forms))

(defmacro frename (pairs &amp;body forms)
  ;;; Rename local lexical functions using macrolet.<a href="#fn10">[11]</a>
  `(macrolet
      ,(mapcar #'(lambda (pair &amp;aux (nfn (car pair)) (fn (cadr pair)))
                   `(,nfn (&amp;rest a) (cons ',fn a)))
               pairs)
      ,@forms))

(defmacro labels (fns &amp;body forms)
  (let* ((inlines (inline-decls forms))       ;retrieve list of fns to inline.
         (notinlines (notinline-decls forms)) ;list to not to inline.
         (forms (strip-decls forms))          ;body without declarations.
         (nfnms (mapcar #'(lambda (ignore) (gensym)) fns)))
    `(let ,nfnms
       (macrolet
        ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f nf)
                     `(,(car f) (&amp;rest a) (list* 'funcall ',nf a)))
                 fns nfnms)
        (frename
         ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f) `(,(notinline-name (car f)) ,(car f))) fns)
         (flet-inline
           ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f) `(,(inline-name (car f)) ,@(cdr f))) fns)
           (frename
             (,@(mapcar #'(lambda (f) `(,f ,(inline-name f))) inlines)
              ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (f) `(,f ,(notinline-name f))) notinlines))
             (setq ,@(mapcan #'(lambda (nf f) `(,nf #',(car f))) nfnms fns))
             ,@forms)))))))

(defmacro locally-inline (fns &amp;body forms)
  ;;; Inline all functions in 'fns' within the body 'forms'.
  `(frename ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f) `(,f ,(inline-name f))) fns)
     ,@forms))

(defmacro locally-notinline (fns &amp;body forms)
  ;;; Call all functions in 'fns' within the body 'forms'.
  `(frename ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f) `(,f ,(notinline f))) fns)
     ,@forms))
</pre></tt>

Once again, the expansion of this form is easier to understand when applied to
our factorial example:

<tt><pre>
(labels ((fact (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
  (declare (inline fact))
  (fact 10)) =&gt;

(let (fact-gensym)
  (macrolet ((fact (&amp;rest a) (list* 'funcall 'fact-gensym a)))
   (frename ((fact-notinline fact))
    (flet-inline ((fact-inline (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
     (frename ((fact fact-inline))
       (setq fact-gensym #'fact)
       (fact 10))))))
</pre></tt>

If we look carefully at the above expansion for <tt>fact</tt>, we see that both
the <tt>setq</tt> and the body of the original <tt>labels</tt> occur within the
same binding environment.  In particular, the name '<tt>fact</tt>' in this
environment means the same thing for occurrences within the original closure
bodies, as well as within the original <tt>labels</tt> body; but this similar
meaning is required by the Common Lisp language definition

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">[Steele90,p.155].</a>

We also see that occurrences of '<tt>fact</tt>' within the body of
<tt>fact-inline</tt> refer to the closed version--i.e., essentially
<tt>fact-notinline</tt>.  Because our definition of <tt>labels</tt>
breaks all circular environments, our compiler is guaranteed not to
expand into infinite program text, although the text size can in the
worst case blow up exponentially.

<h2>
Solution #k
</h2>

Our scheme for inlining has achieved our first goal--an interpretation with a
finite program text which also provides for "one-level" in-line substitution.
Unfortunately, this solution does not scale well, because if we want to inline
a function to depth <i>k</i>, we must predefine a <i>k</i>-level expansion
which can then be selected when the occurrence is encountered.  In order to
avoid pre-defining <tt>k</tt>-level expansions for every function and every
<tt>k</tt>, we must then examine the text bodies to see whether any
<tt>k</tt>-level expansions "occur free" within those bodies.  In other words,
we find it is too expensive to predefine every version of every function,
without first determining if it will ever be called.  Unfortunately, the actual
code for this solution is too large to include here, so we will show only its
expansion for our factorial example.

<tt><pre>
(labels ((fact (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
  (declare (inline-3 fact))
  (fact 10)) =&gt;

(let (fact-gensym)
 (macrolet ((fact (&amp;rest a) (list* 'funcall 'fact-gensym a)))
  (frename ((fact-notinline fact))
   (flet-inline ((fact (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
    (flet-inline ((fact (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
     (flet-inline ((fact (n) (if (zerop n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))))
      (frename ((fact-inline fact))
       (frename ((fact fact-inline))
         (setq fact-gensym #'fact)
         (fact 10)))))))))
</pre></tt>

In the above expansion for <tt>fact</tt>, it is important to notice that each
occurrence of '<tt>fact</tt>' is bound at the next higher level, and thus we
achieve our depth-3 inlining for this function.<p>

We must point out that the above scheme depends upon the generation of
different spellings of the function name to select the different
implementations.  Although this scheme is easy to understand, it is not
<i>safe</i>, in the sense that the names generated by the functions
<tt>inline-name</tt> and <tt>notinline-name</tt> could clash with
programmer-generated names.  A safer scheme would utilize a more sophisticated
scheme for generating names which can not possibly clash with
programmer-generated names.

<h2>
Conclusions
</h2>

We have shown how a precise semantics can be given for the process of
subprogram integration, commonly called "inlining".  Furthermore, these
semantics can provide for a finite interpretation even in the presence of
recursive subroutines.  Our solution to the inlining of recursive functions is
based on a finite-depth analogue to the <tt>Y</tt> operator of the
lambda-calculus, which provides for recursion without requiring loops in the
program text.

We use Common Lisp for many of our examples, because it is the only
standardized language which provides the expressiveness to represent the
different situations to be discussed--e.g., it offers a syntax for anonymous
subprograms, and its parentheses explicitly delimit the scope of its lexical
names.<p>

<a name="fn1">[2]</a>The truth of this statement depends upon the ability of
the macro-expansion to query the lexical environment to determine the
free/bound status of names, and the special/lexical status of variable names;
this ability was only recently proposed for Common Lisp

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">[Steele90,8.5].</a>

<p>

<a name="fn2">[3]</a>Common Lisp now provides for "compiler macros"

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">[Steele90,8.4],</a>

whose functionality is similar to that of compiler optimizers.<p>

<a name="fn3">[4]</a>Of course, this transformation is only a schematic;
lexical variables bound between the definition and occurrence of <tt>foo</tt>
have to be renamed to avoid 'capturing' the free lexical variables of
<tt>foo</tt>, and dynamic variables may require additional processing.
<tt>unwind-protect </tt>also introduces additional complications

<a href="MetaCircular.html">[Baker92MC].</a>

<p>

<a name="fn4">[5]</a>An Ada-83 program can't actually <i>do</i> anything with
the address of a function/procedure, however, because Ada-83 has no
function/procedure datatype and no <tt>apply</tt> or <tt>funcall</tt> mechanism
to call this procedure by its address.<p>

<a name="fn5">[6]</a>Common Lisp would have more consistent semantics if it
provided for a <i>constant</i> <tt>symbol-function</tt> binding; such a
declaration is implicit in

<a href="ObjectIdentity.html">[Baker93ER].</a>

<p>

<a name="fn6">[7]</a>Many compiler/linker systems already support this
optimization for more prosaic purposes.  This optimization is not semantically
transparent in Lisp, however, because <tt>eval</tt> could attempt to reference
the function at any time, and the optimization must therefore must be under the
control of the programmer.<p>

<a name="fn7">[8]</a>We have run into more than one compiler system whose
scheme for deleting unreferenced subroutines is flawed.  By placing the
responsibility for this activity on the linker, the optimization need be
debugged but once.<p>

<a name="fn8">[9]</a>Even without the overheads of complex code management
systems, many Lisp systems already have the capability to do "meta-point",
which retrieves the ASCII source text for a given function into an editor
window.<p>

<a name="fn9">[10]</a>Program text with cycles is typical for machine language
and microprogramming; goto's create these cycles.  <i>Combinator reduction
machines</i> [Turner79] typically introduce cycles into the program texts for
recursive programs.<p>

<a name="fn10">[11]</a>We could have used <tt>flet-inline</tt> to define
<tt>frename</tt>, but <tt>macrolet</tt> is more succinct.
