I recently had occasion to write a significant program in PASCAL (a
compiler) which made extensive use of PASCAL's list-processing and
functional facilities.  Although I was much impressed by other
features of PASCAL, I was appalled by the number of redundant
identifiers required to write this code.<p>

Redundant identifiers have several costs.  Larger symbol tables mean
more storage during compilation, larger cross-reference listings, and
more storage during symbolic debugging.  However, the most significant
cost is the conceptual load the extra identifiers place on the persons
writing and maintaining the code.<p>

The identifier redundancies come from the interaction of PASCAL's
restrictions on pointer definitions and its restrictions on type
specifications in parameter lists.<p>

Consider the following (unfortunately illegal) PASCAL program:

<tt><pre>
PROGRAM typetest1;
TYPE
  lhsexp = ^ RECORD
               CASE op: (simple,pointer,qualified,subscripted) OF
                 simple: (name: ALFA);
                 pointer: (pbase: lhsexp);
                 qualified: (qbase: lhsexp; field: ALFA);
                 subscripted: (abase: lhsexp; index: rhsexp)
             END;
  rhsexp = ^ RECORD
               CASE op: (variable,plus,minus,times) OF
                 variable: (reference: lhsexp);
                 plus,minus,times: (left,right: rhsexp)
             END;
  FUNCTION conssubscript(base: lhsexp; index: rhsexp): lhsexp;
    BEGIN
    END;
  BEGIN
  END.
</pre></tt>

The program above is illegal because PASCAL restricts the type
expression following the "^" in type definitions to be a type
identifier.  One possible way to change the program to make it legal
PASCAL is to shift the names "lhsexp" and "rhsexp" from being pointers
to records to being records themselves, as in the following code:

<tt><pre>
PROGRAM typetest2;
TYPE
  lhsexp = RECORD
             CASE op: (simple,pointer,qualified,subscript) OF
               simple: (name: ALFA);
               pointer: (pbase: ^ lhsexp);
               qualified: (qbase: ^ lhsexp; field: ALFA);
               subscripted: (abase: ^ lhsexp; index: ^ rhsexp)
             END;
  rhsexp = RECORD
             CASE op: (variable,plus,minus,times) OF
               variable: (reference: ^ lhsexp);
               plus,minus,times: (left,right: ^ rhsexp)
           END;
  FUNCTION conssubscript(base: ^lhsexp; index: ^rhsexp): ^lhsexp;
    BEGIN
    END;
  BEGIN
  END.
</pre></tt>

This change makes the type definition work, and avoids the undefined
type identifier from the mutually recursive type definitions, but is
illegal because "^" is not allowed in a parameter list!  Thus, one is
required to name both the record and the pointer to the record,
resulting in more names than are necessary to describe the data
structures that one needs.<p>

The program shown above also illustrates that incomprehensibility of
another PASCAL restriction, namely, that the type expression for the
discriminant of a variant RECORD must be a type identifier.  This
results in yet another name which is redundant in that it will not be
referenced outside the one reference inside the CASE clause of the
RECORD definition.<p>

To summarize, then, we give a legal PASCAL program which exhibits clearly the
extra names required by the unnecessary restrictions of PASCAL.

<tt><pre>
PROGRAM typetest3;
TYPE
  unneeded1 = (simple,pointer,qualified,subscripted);
  lhsexp = RECORD
             CASE op: unneeded1 OF
               simple: (name: ALFA);
               pointer: (pbase: ^lhsexp);
               qualified: (qbase: ^lhsexp; field: ALFA);
               subscripted: (abase: ^lhsexp; index: ^rhsexp)
           END;
  unneeded2 = ^lhsexp;
  unneeded3 = (variable,plus,minus,times);
  rhsexp = RECORD
             CASE op: unneeded3 OF
               variable: (reference: ^lhsexp);
               plus,minus,times: (left,right: ^rhsexp)
           END;
  unneeded4 = ^rhsexp;
  FUNCTION conssubscript(base: unneeded2; index: unneeded4): unneeded2;
    BEGIN
    END;
  BEGIN
  END.
</pre></tt>

Thus, we see that because of the unnecessary type restrictions in
PASCAL, each different list record requires 3 names instead of only 1,
a fact which costs every PASCAL application time and money.  We note
in conclusion that ADA allows a program analogous to "typetest1", so
this direction is probably the correct one for any PASCAL standard to
take.
